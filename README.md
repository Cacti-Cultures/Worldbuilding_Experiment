# Experiments in semi-autonomous worldbuilding

## Executive Overview

This experiment will be in generating worldbuilding related elements and using a semi-automous GPT3.5-turbo agent to iterate and create scenarios and fanatsy races. 

This is a personal project based on the much more important **Reinforcement Learning with Heuristic Imperatives (RLHI)** project by @daveshap, which you can find here: https://github.com/daveshap/RLHI
