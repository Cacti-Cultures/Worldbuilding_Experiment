CONSIDERATIONS:
- The concept of Tsukumogami is not well-known outside of Japan, so some readers may not be familiar with it. It may be helpful to provide some context or background information to help readers understand what Tsukumogami are and their significance in Japanese folklore.
- The description of their society could benefit from more detail on their customs, traditions, and daily life. For example, what kind of ancestor-worship do they practice? What kind of conflicts arise in their society and how are they resolved? What kind of technology do they possess and how does it affect their daily lives?

ACTION:
The Tsukumogami are an interesting and unique addition to the low fantasy world, and I believe their society can be further developed to create a more robust and immersive experience. Here are some suggestions for improving and expanding upon the existing description:

- Provide a brief explanation of what Tsukumogami are, their origins, and their significance in Japanese folklore. This will help readers understand the context of their society and their beliefs.
- Expand on their customs and traditions, such as their ancestor-worship practices. Do they have specific rituals or ceremonies? How do they honor their ancestors? Are there any taboos or restrictions related to ancestor-worship?
- Describe their daily life in more detail. How do they gather food and resources? What kind of activities do they engage in? How do they spend their leisure time?
- Explore their architecture and technology in more depth. How do they build homes into mountains? What kind of tools and materials do they use? How has technology influenced their society and way of life?
- Elaborate on their language and clothing. What makes their language polysynthetic? What are some common phrases or expressions in their language? How do they make their beaded clothing and what does it represent in their culture?
- Finally, consider adding some conflict or tension to their society. While they may have a harmonious culture, there could be some internal or external factors that threaten their way of life. This could create a more dynamic and engaging narrative.
