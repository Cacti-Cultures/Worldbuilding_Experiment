CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the Selkies' society and culture is intriguing, but it could benefit from more details to fully immerse the reader in this world. For example, what are their beliefs in paganism? What are some examples of the libertarian laws they follow?
- The reason for the impending conflict and dissatisfaction with the current leadership is unclear. It would be helpful to explain why the geothermal technology is not enough to sustain their society and why some Selkies are seeking change.
- The term "necrocracy" is not commonly used and may confuse readers. It would be helpful to explain what this means in the context of the Selkies' society.

ACTION:
In the world of the Selkies, a robust society of planktivorous and dominant beings who lived in cave dwellings within the peaks, adventure was the norm. Their language was vowel-heavy, and their fashion was muted, but their respect for each other was unparalleled. The Selkies followed the beliefs of paganism, worshiping the spirits of their ancestors and the natural world. They lived a socialist lifestyle, where wealth and resources were shared equally among all, and followed a set of libertarian laws that emphasized personal freedom and self-determination.

However, an uprising was brewing among the Selkies, and discordant voices were growing louder. The geothermal technology used by the farmers was not enough to sustain their society, and the Selkies were beginning to feel the pinch. The current leadership was struggling to find a solution, and some Selkies felt that more drastic measures were necessary to secure their future.

As tensions rose, the Selkies began to split into factions, with some advocating for a return to their traditional ways of life and others pushing for more technological advancements. The wind symbols that had long been used to communicate within their society were no longer enough to express the depth of their disagreements.

Despite their differences, the Selkies remained respectful towards each other, and they hoped to find a peaceful solution to their problems. However, as the situation grew more desperate, some began to question the legitimacy of the necrocracy that had governed their society for generations.

As the Selkies struggled to find a way forward, they were confronted with a new threat. A group of sea monsters had begun to attack their coastal villages, threatening their way of life and further destabilizing their society. The Selkies would need to unite and work together if they hoped to survive this new challenge.

Overall, this rewritten scenario adds more details to the Selkies' society and culture, explains the reasons for the impending conflict, and introduces a new external threat to their world. The goal is to create a more immersive and engaging world for readers to explore.
