CONSIDERATIONS: 
- The sanguivorous diet of some griffins could be explained more seamlessly into the story, as it seems to contradict their noble and chivalrous reputation. 
- It may be helpful to have more information on how the griffins played a key role in the enlightenment events in the coral reefs, as this seems like an interesting plot point that could be expanded upon. 
- The fascist laws of Matte seem to clash with the communalism practiced by the griffins, and it may be worth exploring how this tension affects the griffin community.

ACTION:
In the feudal society of Matte, the griffins were revered for their chivalrous behavior and noble character, but their sanguivorous diets were often misunderstood by other species. While some griffins did feed on blood, they did so only as a last resort and were highly selective in their choice of prey. Despite this, rumors persisted about the griffins' savage nature, leading to discrimination and persecution against those who did not conform to the strict dietary norms of the society.

However, the griffins' reputation as noble creatures was not unfounded. They played a key role in the enlightenment events that took place in the coral reefs, using their keen intellect and innovative thinking to solve complex problems and advance scientific knowledge. Their monotheistic religion and communal economics also fostered a strong sense of community and cooperation within the griffin society, with potters and other craftsmen working together to create beautiful and functional works of art.

Despite their many virtues, the griffins faced significant challenges in the fascist society of Matte. The laws were often unjust and oppressive, and conflict was resolved through appeasement rather than justice. This created tension within the griffin community, as their communalism clashed with the fascist ideology of the ruling class. However, the griffins remained committed to their principles of fairness and compassion, using their medieval technology and nurturing nature to help those in need and make a positive impact on the world around them.
