ACTION:
The fae society of Dull had always been an anocracy, with power constantly shifting between different factions. Despite this, the community remained vibrant, with colorful festivals and a strong sense of independence. However, the recent drought that plagued the steppes had left the fae feeling unambitious and struggling to survive on their mycophagous diets. The cause of the drought was a mystery to the fae, but rumors circulated that it was caused by a powerful sorcerer who sought to weaken their society for his own gain.

The factions within the fae society were varied and complex. The largest faction was the traditionalists, who believed in maintaining the shamanism religion and the monarchic laws that had kept their society in order for centuries. However, there were also smaller factions who sought to challenge these beliefs. The progressives believed that the fae needed to adapt to the changing times and embrace technology and consumerism. The egalitarians believed that power should be shared equally among all fae, and that the monarchic laws were outdated and unfair.

The shift towards consumerism was led by the progressives, who had begun to trade with neighboring human settlements for goods and technology. This had led to a growing divide within the fae society, with some embracing the new way of life and others shunning it as a threat to their traditions.

The passing comet was seen by the fae as a sign of hope, with some believing that it was a sign of a coming change in their fortunes. The shamanic priests interpreted the comet as a message from their ancestors, urging them to remain strong and unified in the face of adversity.

The fae's burrow-like architecture was integral to their society, with each burrow housing a family or small group of fae. The burrows were interconnected by a network of tunnels, which allowed for easy communication and efficient travel. However, the cramped living quarters could sometimes lead to conflict, especially in times of scarcity.

As the drought continued, the fae were left wondering if they needed a new form of governance to survive. The factions within their society grew more combative, with each vying for control over dwindling resources. The future of the fae was uncertain, but they remained determined to persevere in the face of adversity.
