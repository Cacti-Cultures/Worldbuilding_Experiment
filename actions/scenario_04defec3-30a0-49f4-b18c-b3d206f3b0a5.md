CONSIDERATIONS:

- The description of the yetis' culture and society is interesting, but it could benefit from more details on their daily life, social dynamics, and beliefs. 
- The patrilineal aspect of their society could be explored further to understand how it affects gender roles and relationships. 
- The use of symbols for communication could be elaborated on to better understand how it works and how it affects their communication. 
- The yetis' occupation of brewing seems random and disconnected from their otherwise nature-oriented lifestyle, and could be better explained or replaced with a more fitting occupation. 
- The yetis' religion being apatheism seems contradictory to their harmonious relationship with nature, and could be further explained or replaced with a belief system that aligns better with their values. 

ACTION:

The yetis' society is a fascinating one to explore, and I think it could benefit from some changes to make it more cohesive and intriguing. Here are some possible actions:

- Expand on the yetis' daily life and social dynamics, including their family structures, education, and leisure activities. This could help readers better understand their culture and relate to the characters. 
- Instead of a patrilineal society, make the yetis a matriarchal or egalitarian society, where gender roles are not as strict and power is shared more evenly. This could create more interesting dynamics and challenge traditional gender norms. 
- Elaborate on the use of symbols for communication, including how they were developed and how they convey complex emotions and ideas. This could add a unique and intriguing aspect to the yetis' culture. 
- Replace the yetis' occupation of brewing with a different occupation that aligns better with their nature-oriented lifestyle, such as farming or hunting. This could create a more cohesive and believable society. 
- Replace the yetis' apatheistic religion with a belief system that reflects their harmonious relationship with nature, such as animism or nature worship. This could add depth and meaning to their culture and actions. 

Overall, these actions could help create a more cohesive and intriguing society of yetis that readers can connect with and care about.
