CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the Satyrs' society is a bit scattered and could benefit from more structure and coherence.
- The mention of their diet being "planktivorous" seems out of place and could be omitted unless it serves a specific purpose.
- The description of their language being agglutinative could be expanded upon or explained more seamlessly into the story.
- The mention of their laws being fascist could be controversial and should be handled with care.

ACTION:
In the plateau of the Satyrs, a hunched and devotional society of creatures lived under a celestocracy that valued justice and spiritualism. Despite their undisciplined nature leading to conflicts, the Satyrs were known for their open-mindedness and eagerness to learn. They were in the Bronze Age and had developed advanced blacksmithing techniques, which were the backbone of their economy. 

Their architecture was futuristic, featuring domed buildings intricately carved with dragon symbols. The Satyrs used their knowledge of bronze technology to create intricate weapons that were both beautiful and deadly. They were also skilled in the art of war and had a strong sense of justice.

The Satyrs' language was agglutinative, and their laws were strict but fair. Dissent was not tolerated, but the Satyrs were always open to new ideas and knowledge. They had a deep respect for nature and often held ceremonies to honor the spirits of the land.

When their land was invaded by a neighboring tribe, the Satyrs were able to use their advanced technology and skilled warriors to fend off their enemies. Their sense of justice and fairness allowed them to emerge victorious, but not without casualties on both sides.

Overall, the Satyrs were a complex and fascinating society, with a rich culture and a deep love for knowledge and progress.
