CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the Titans' physical appearance is vague, and it would be helpful to provide more details to help readers visualize them better.
- The Titans' diet being scavenger-based seems out of place in a society that values collectivism and the greater good. It might be worth exploring why this is the case and if there are any cultural reasons behind it.
- The Titans' religion and totemism could be further developed to provide a better understanding of their belief system and how it impacts their daily lives.
- The use of whistled language is an interesting detail, but it would be helpful to explain how it evolved and how it works in practice.

ACTION:
The Titans were a society of muscular beings, standing tall at an average height of eight feet. Their skin was a deep shade of red, and their eyes were a bright, glowing yellow. Their hair was thick and black, often braided and adorned with feathers and beads. 

The Titans' diet consisted mainly of scavenged meat, which they considered a necessary evil to sustain their physical strength. Their collectivist culture meant that everyone contributed to the hunt and that the spoils were shared equally. Despite this, there was still a sense of competition among the Titans, with some hunters trying to outdo others in the size and rarity of their prey.

The Titans' religion was based on totemism, with each clan having a specific totem animal that they revered and emulated. The totem animals were seen as guides and protectors, and the Titans would often perform elaborate dances and rituals to honor them. 

The Titans' language was mostly whistled, which had evolved as a way to communicate over long distances in their vast and rugged environment. The whistles were complex and nuanced, allowing for subtle changes in tone and pitch to convey different meanings. 

Judicial conflict resolution was common among the Titans, with disputes often settled by a council of elders who would listen to both sides and then make a decision based on the evidence presented. Their laws were retributive, with punishment often swift and severe. 

The Titans' architecture was dominated by domes, with many of their buildings made from a combination of clay and stone. The weavers were highly respected for their skills in creating intricate designs that often featured the symbol of the dragon, which was seen as a powerful and auspicious creature.

Overall, the Titans were a society deeply rooted in kinship and collectivism, with a strong connection to the natural world. While they had their flaws and conflicts, their positive energy was contagious, and their devotion to their totem animals and the greater good made them a force to be reckoned with in their harsh and unforgiving world.
