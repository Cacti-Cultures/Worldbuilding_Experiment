CONSIDERATIONS:
- The concept of a "spiky society" is intriguing but could benefit from further explanation or worldbuilding. What makes this society spiky? Is it their physical appearance? Their architecture? Their personality traits?
- It is not entirely clear how their frugivorous diet and living in harmony with nature relates to their religion and culture. Further explanation or connection could enhance the worldbuilding.
- The sudden mention of a renaissance era is jarring and could benefit from more context or explanation.
- The use of the term "fascist corporatism economy" suggests a specific political ideology, but it is not clear how it fits within the world of low fantasy.
- The conflict with neighboring societies is mentioned, but it is not clear what caused it or what the stakes are.

ACTION:
In the spiky society that inhabits the caverns, the golems were a harmonious force. They had sharp, spiky features that allowed them to blend in seamlessly with the jagged rocks and stalactites of their cavernous homes. Their architecture was similarly spiky, with buildings that seemed to grow out of the natural formations around them. The golems were known for their stoicism and their unwavering commitment to their mystic religion, which emphasized the importance of harmony with nature and the power of serpents to guide them.

The golems' frugivorous diet was a reflection of their belief in the importance of living in harmony with the natural world. They believed that by consuming only the fruits and nuts that grew in their caverns, they could maintain a balance between themselves and the environment. This belief extended to their cultural practices, which were deeply ritualistic and focused on honoring the natural world.

The golems' commitment to their mystic religion led them to a renaissance of artistic and intellectual pursuits. They developed a harmonic language that allowed them to communicate complex ideas and emotions through sound and rhythm. Their bardic occupations were highly respected, and their music and poetry were sought after by neighboring societies.

However, the golems' commitment to their pacifist ideals made them vulnerable to exploitation by neighboring societies. Their matrilineal laws, which placed women in positions of power, were seen as a weakness by some, and neighboring societies took advantage of this to infiltrate their government and exploit their resources.

Despite this, the golems continued to spread their message of love and hospitality, hoping that one day, they could live in a world where harmony triumphed over conflict. They knew that the road ahead would be long and difficult, but they remained committed to their ideals, believing that by staying true to themselves, they could inspire others to do the same.
