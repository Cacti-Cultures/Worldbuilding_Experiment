CONSIDERATIONS:
- The yetis seem to have a well-developed society and culture, but it is not clear what their physical characteristics are or how they interact with other creatures in their environment. Adding more detail to their appearance and behavior could make the story more immersive.
- The plague is mentioned briefly, but it would be helpful to know more about its symptoms and how it is affecting the yetis. This could help to build tension and make the stakes feel higher.
- The shaman is referenced as a source of guidance, but it is not clear what their role is in yeti society or how they are chosen. Exploring this aspect could add depth to the culture and help to explain why the yetis trust the shaman's advice.

ACTION:
Deep in the taiga, a robust society of yetis thrived in their unique aristocracy. Towering over most creatures in the forest, the yetis were covered in thick, white fur that kept them warm in the harsh winters. They were known for their powerful builds and sharp claws, which they used for hunting and defense. Despite their intimidating appearance, the yetis were a peaceful people who valued knowledge and harmony above all else.

Recently, a plague had swept through their community, causing a wave of panic and uncertainty. The yetis began to show symptoms of lethargy and loss of appetite, leading to a shortage of food and resources. The floating islands that they had built over the years were slowly sinking, and the once-lively community was now quiet and subdued.

In their desperation, the yetis turned to their shaman, a wise and respected member of their society. The shaman was a small, elderly yeti who had earned their position through years of study and meditation. They spent their days communing with the spirits of the forest and seeking guidance from the gods.

The shaman listened to the concerns of the yetis and meditated on the problem. They consulted with the spirits and the gods, searching for a solution that would satisfy everyone. Finally, they emerged from their trance with a plan.

The yetis would need to adapt their diet to survive the plague. They would have to hunt more frequently and forage for new sources of food. They would also need to work together to repair their floating islands and ensure their survival.

The yetis listened to the shaman's advice and began to implement their plan. They worked tirelessly to repair their homes and gather food, and slowly but surely, their community began to thrive once again.

Through their discipline and determination, the yetis had overcome the odds and found a way to survive. They had proven that even in the face of adversity, their society could stand strong and continue to flourish.
