CONSIDERATIONS:
- The scenario mentions a "planktivorous population" causing famine, but it's not clear what this population is or how it's relevant to the story. It may be helpful to explain this term more clearly or provide more context.
- The use of the term "Einherjar" doesn't seem to fit with the low fantasy setting described. Einherjar are typically associated with Norse mythology and a more high fantasy setting. It may be better to use a different term or come up with a new name for the hunters in this society.
- The igloos mentioned seem out of place in a marshland environment. Igloos are typically associated with snow and ice, so it may be more appropriate to use a different type of shelter or explain why igloos were necessary in this specific situation.

ACTION:
In the marshlands of the polished society, the people were facing famine due to overfishing of the local rivers. The society relied on their skilled hunters, known as the Marshstalkers, to provide food for the community. However, the hunters struggled to keep up with demand and often returned with meager catches. Despite this, the society's culture of innovation encouraged them to find new ways to survive.

They turned to their ancestor-worshipping religion for guidance and sought reconciliation with the environment. The willow tree symbolized their desire for growth and renewal, and they began to plant willows along the riverbanks to encourage the growth of fish populations. They also implemented a system of rotational fishing, allowing the river to recover between harvests.

As the society adapted to the changing environment, they also developed new technology to aid in their survival. The Marshstalkers began using spears and nets to more efficiently catch fish, and the society as a whole developed a new type of shelter made from woven reeds and mud.

The society's laws were restorative, focusing on healing and reconciliation rather than punishment. When conflicts arose, the community would come together to discuss the issue and find a solution that benefited everyone involved.

Through their ingenuity and determination, the society not only survived but thrived in their harsh environment. The Marshstalkers became revered for their skill and bravery, and the willow tree became a symbol of the community's resilience in the face of adversity.
