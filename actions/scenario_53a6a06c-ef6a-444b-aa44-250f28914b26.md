CONSIDERATIONS:

- While the description of the changelings' society is detailed, it would be helpful to have more information on their physical appearance and abilities. This would provide a more complete picture of the race and aid in worldbuilding.
- The mention of their reputation for dishonorable tactics in times of war could be expanded upon. What tactics do they employ, and why are they considered dishonorable? This would add depth to the changelings' society and provide context for their beliefs and actions.
- The significance of the wolf symbol in their language is mentioned, but it would be beneficial to explain why this symbol is so important to the changelings. Is it tied to their religion or cultural history?

ACTION:

The tailed changelings were a race of shapeshifters, able to transform into any creature they desired. They had long, slender tails that could be used for both balance and communication, as they were able to convey emotions through their movements. Their society was built upon a foundation of prudence, with every decision carefully weighed and considered before action was taken.

In times of war, the changelings were known to employ tactics that many considered dishonorable. They would often trick their enemies into thinking they were outnumbered, only to reveal their true strength once the battle had begun. This tactic was seen as cowardly by some, but the changelings believed that it was better to win the war with minimal loss of life.

Despite their reputation for dishonorable tactics, the changelings had a culture of hospitality. Travelers were welcomed into their stilt houses in the dunes and offered insectivorous dishes as a sign of respect. Animism was their religion, and they believed that every creature had a spirit. This belief extended to their own shapeshifting abilities, as they saw themselves as vessels for the spirits of the creatures they transformed into.

The changelings had a market socialist economy, but they placed more value on communal living than individual wealth. Potters were highly regarded in their society, showcasing their intricate designs and creating beautiful pieces that were traded throughout the land. Decorative fashion was also becoming more popular, with elaborate headdresses and jewelry becoming a symbol of status.

The wolf symbol was highly regarded in their polysynthetic language, representing both strength and cunning. It was tied to their cultural history, with legends of a great wolf who protected their ancestors from harm. Egalitarian laws were followed, but the changelings had a confrontational attitude towards those who challenged their way of life. Their ignorance of the outside world often led to misunderstandings, but they were always willing to learn and adapt.
