CONSIDERATIONS:

- The description of the Lamia people's religion is brief and could be expanded upon. It would be interesting to know more about their beliefs and practices surrounding ancestor-worship.

- It is unclear why the occupation of bard is so highly respected in Lamia. What is the significance of storytelling in their culture?

- The lack of verbs in the Lamia language could be further explored. How do they communicate effectively with each other without the use of verbs?

ACTION:

The Lamia people are a unique and complex race, with a culture that revolves around kinship, nature, and ancestor-worship. However, I feel that there are some areas that could benefit from further development. 

In terms of their religion, it would be interesting to explore the specific rituals and beliefs that surround ancestor-worship in more detail. Perhaps the Lamia people believe that their ancestors have a direct influence on their daily lives, or that they can communicate with them in some way. 

Regarding the occupation of bard, it could be explained that storytelling is considered a sacred duty in Lamia culture. The bards are responsible for preserving the history and traditions of their people, and their stories are seen as a way to connect with their ancestors and honor their legacy. 

Finally, the verb-less nature of the Lamia language could be further explored. It could be explained that the language relies heavily on context and nonverbal communication, such as body language and tone of voice. Visitors to Lamia may struggle to communicate effectively at first, but with time and practice, they can learn to understand the nuances of the language. 

Overall, these additions would give the Lamia people a deeper and more fleshed-out culture, making them a more intriguing race to explore within the fantasy world.
