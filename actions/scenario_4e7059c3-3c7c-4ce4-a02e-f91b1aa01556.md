ACTION:
In the land of Lithe, sorcerers held the power in an ergatocracy, where the ruling class were those who labored the hardest. Their society was built on a strong foundation of polytheistic faith, with each sorcerer dedicating themselves to a particular deity or pantheon. They believed that magic was a gift from the gods, and that it was their responsibility to use it to better the world around them.

However, the Renaissance had brought about a resurgence of interest in their magic, and many sorcerers had become disillusioned with the traditional ways of their society. Anarcho-capitalism had crept into the economy, causing a divide amongst the sorcerers. Some were content with their folivorous diets, while others had become brewers and were more interested in the seasonal fashion trends that had emerged.

Despite these divisions, the castle-like architecture and authoritative laws still stood as a symbol of their power. The nature of their magic was complex and varied, with each sorcerer specializing in a particular discipline. Some were masters of elemental magic, while others were skilled in divination or healing. However, their loyalty to one another was what kept their society from collapsing.

The comet in the night sky was a constant reminder of their fear of the unknown. It was said that every time the comet appeared, a great tragedy would befall their society. Some believed that it was a sign of the gods' displeasure, while others thought it was a warning of impending doom.

Despite the complexities of their language being polysynthetic, they had developed a strong system of communication that allowed them to work together seamlessly. Their loyalty to one another was not just a matter of tradition or obligation, but a genuine bond that transcended their differences.

Overall, the society of Lithe was a complex and intriguing one, with a rich history and culture that was both unique and fascinating.
