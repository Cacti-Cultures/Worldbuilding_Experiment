CONSIDERATIONS: 

- The description of the society is quite detailed, but it could benefit from more information on the daily lives and customs of the people. 
- It's not clear what kind of threats or challenges the society faces, which could add depth to the worldbuilding. 
- The description of the economy being focused on conservationist practices for a green future seems somewhat vague and could be fleshed out more. 
- The subterfuge aspect of the society seems out of place given the description of their egalitarian laws, so this could be clarified or expanded upon. 
- The lack of creativity and innovation could be tied back to the asceticism religion, but this is not explicitly stated.

ACTION: 

In the misty wetlands of Yokai, a society of stoic herbivorous farmers lived in simple cliffside dwellings, adorned with decorative symbols of the phoenix. Despite their egalitarian laws, the society was rigid and dull, with a phylarchy system in place. The religion of asceticism prevailed, and the economy was focused on conservationist practices for a green future. The language spoken was sibilant, and the fashion was ornate and decorative. 

Despite the society's commitment to fairness and environmentalism, they faced a constant threat from raiding parties of carnivorous beasts that roamed the wetlands. To combat this, the society had developed a sophisticated system of traps and alarms, and every member of society was trained in combat to defend themselves and their crops. 

The society's subterfuge was born out of necessity, as they had to keep their trap designs and combat tactics secret from the raiders. This led to a culture of secrecy and distrust, where even close family members would keep their plans and intentions hidden from each other. 

The asceticism religion preached that material possessions and luxuries were distractions from spiritual enlightenment, and as a result, the society placed a high value on simplicity and frugality. However, this also stifled creativity and innovation, leading to a lack of technological advancement. 

To address this, a small group of rebels emerged within the society, advocating for a more balanced approach to life that allowed for both spiritual growth and technological progress. They faced persecution from the asceticism sect, but over time, their ideas began to gain traction, leading to a more dynamic and innovative society. 

Overall, the society of Yokai became known for their commitment to environmentalism and fairness, as well as their ingenuity and resourcefulness in the face of constant danger.
