CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the mummies' society could be expanded upon to give a clearer understanding of their customs, traditions, and way of life.
- It is not clear why the mummies are seen as untrustworthy by outsiders, and this could be explained further.
- The concept of a "monothestic religion" could be explored in more detail, including its beliefs and practices.

ACTION:
In the dark age of the tellurocracy ruled by a fascist corporatism, the mummies lived in a society that was in complete harmony with nature. They were a peaceful and humble people who lived off what the dunes provided them. Their homes were cave dwellings that blended seamlessly with the natural landscape, and their clothing and fashion were made from natural materials found in their environment. Their religion was based on the worship of the moon, which they saw as a symbol of hope and guidance.

The mummies communicated using a unique sign language that allowed them to avoid conflict and maintain their avoidance culture. This culture was based on the belief that conflict only led to suffering and that peace and harmony with nature were the keys to a happy life. While they did have laws in place that could be seen as totalitarian, they were never imposed on others and were only meant to ensure that their society remained in balance.

Outsiders viewed the mummies as untrustworthy because of their avoidance of conflict and their reluctance to engage in the politics of the world around them. This led to them being seen as isolationist and uncooperative, which only served to reinforce the idea that they were untrustworthy. However, those who took the time to study the mummies' ways found that they were a peaceful and wise people who had much to offer.

The mummies' religion was unique in that it was monotheistic, but its beliefs and practices were unlike any others in the world. They believed that the moon was a symbol of their god's love and guidance, and that by following its cycles, they could live in harmony with the world around them. Their religious practices included meditation, prayer, and the creation of intricate art pieces that were meant to represent the moon and its cycles.

Despite the destructive nature of the world around them, the mummies maintained their peaceful society with a sense of harmony and contentment. They knew that the world was a dangerous and unpredictable place, but they also believed that by living in harmony with nature, they could find happiness and fulfillment in their lives.
