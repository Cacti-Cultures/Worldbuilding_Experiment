CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the Yuki-onna as folivorous people could be better integrated into the story. It seems like a detail that doesn't necessarily add to the plot or worldbuilding.
- It's unclear why the Yuki-onna's religion of apatheism has led to a lack of conflict resolution skills. This could be expanded upon to make it more believable.
- The division between the apathetic and the hopeful is an interesting conflict, but it could be made more clear what specifically has caused this divide.

ACTION:
In a dystopian world where society has taken to the skies, the Yuki-onna live in a terraced city overlooking the vast savannah below. Despite their innovative culture and primordial technology, the Yuki-onna have fallen under the rule of a fascist corporatist government that values utilitarianism over individuality. The society has become apathetic, with many feeling hopeless about their future. However, a hopeful few have begun to speak out and plan an exodus from their aerial city in search of a better life.

The Yuki-onna are a people who have adapted to their environment by becoming adept at farming and cultivating the plants that grow on the floating islands that make up their city. They wear uniform clothing adorned with symbols of stars, which represent their belief that they are all connected to each other and the universe. They speak in a sibilant language that is difficult for outsiders to understand.

Despite the egalitarian laws in place, the society remains divided between those who have given up hope and those who believe in a better future. This divide has led to a lack of conflict resolution skills, as the apathetic Yuki-onna do not see the point in resolving disputes. However, a group of mediators, including a skilled blacksmith, have stepped forward to help facilitate the journey of those who wish to leave the city.

As the exodus draws near, tensions between the two groups continue to rise. The hopeful Yuki-onna are determined to leave the city and search for a better life, while the apathetic Yuki-onna see no point in leaving and fear what lies beyond the safety of their city. The mediators must work hard to keep the peace and ensure that the exodus is successful.

In the end, the Yuki-onna who leave the city find that the world below is more dangerous than they could have imagined. They encounter hostile creatures and struggle to find food and water. But they also discover that there are other societies like theirs, who have managed to survive and even thrive in this harsh world. As they journey on, they begin to understand that they are not alone and that there is hope for a better future.
