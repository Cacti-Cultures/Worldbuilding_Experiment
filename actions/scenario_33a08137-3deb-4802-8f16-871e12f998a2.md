CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the Dryads as "insectivorous" and "practicing consumerism" seem out of place in a low fantasy setting. These details could be removed or reworked to fit better within the context.
- While the mention of the Dryads' monotheistic religion adds depth to their culture, more information could be added to give greater insight into their beliefs and practices.
- The use of industrial technology also seems out of place in a low fantasy setting. This could be reworked or explained more seamlessly to fit within the worldbuilding.

Recently, a group of outsiders had arrived in their homeland, disrupting the balance of nature and causing the Dryads to become agitated and fearful. They had formed a council to discuss how best to deal with these intruders, and were considering sending out a group of skilled hunters to drive them away.
