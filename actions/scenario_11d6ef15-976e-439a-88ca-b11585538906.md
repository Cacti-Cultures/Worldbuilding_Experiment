CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the gnomes' informal economy that relies heavily on their carnivorous diet seems disconnected from their conservation and nature nurturing beliefs. It could be explained how they maintain balance and avoid over-hunting.
- The mention of their deep appreciation for bards seems random and could be better integrated into the overall society and culture of the gnomes.
- More information could be provided on how their theistic beliefs manifest in their daily lives and practices.
- While their logographic language is interesting, it would be helpful to know how it sounds and how it is written.

ACTION:
The gnomes' carnivorous diet and their conservation and nature nurturing beliefs can be better connected by explaining how they practice sustainable hunting and fishing techniques, as well as how they use the remains of their food for fertilization and other purposes. 

To better integrate the role of bards in their society, they could be seen as storytellers who pass down the history and beliefs of the gnomes through song and poetry. They could also be responsible for providing entertainment during celebrations and rituals.

Their theistic beliefs could be further explained by describing their deities and how they are worshipped, as well as how their beliefs inform their views on life and death.

As for their logographic language, it could be described as a series of symbols that represent words and concepts. The symbols could be based on natural shapes and patterns, reflecting their deep connection to the environment.

Overall, these additions and clarifications will help to enrich the worldbuilding of the gnomes and make their society feel more cohesive and immersive.
