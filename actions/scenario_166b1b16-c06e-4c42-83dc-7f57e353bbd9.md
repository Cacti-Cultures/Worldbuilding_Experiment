CONSIDERATIONS:
- The concept of a transparent society is interesting but it is not clear how it is implemented in Garuda. More details on how they achieve transparency could make the society more believable.
- The idea of a xenocracy is unique and raises questions about how it affects the society's relationships with neighboring cultures. This could be explored further.
- The cataclysmic event that led to their downfall seems to be a result of their rejection of outsiders. It would be helpful to know more about their reasons for rejecting outsiders and how they could have possibly avoided this event.
- The description of their technology is vague and could benefit from more detail to help paint a clearer picture of their society.

ACTION:
Garuda was a society that prided itself on transparency, where every member had access to all information. However, this transparency was not achieved through technology but rather through a unique form of communication. Garudans had the ability to directly communicate with each other's minds, allowing for a shared consciousness among the society. 

Their form of governance was a xenocracy, where only non-natives could hold positions of power. This was initially established to prevent corruption and ensure fairness in decision-making, but it also led to a sense of superiority among Garudans towards outsiders. 

The Garudans' rejection of outsiders was rooted in their belief that outsiders could not understand or appreciate their values of kinship and animism. They saw themselves as protectors of the environment and believed that their way of life was the only way to do so. 

This rejection of outsiders eventually led to a cataclysmic event when a neighboring rainforest tribe attacked them. The Garudans were caught off guard and their medieval technology was no match for the rainforest tribe's more advanced weaponry. In the aftermath of the attack, the Garudans realized the importance of building relationships with neighboring cultures and began to establish trade relations.

The occupation of a tanner continued to be highly respected in Garuda, as their skill in working with animal hides was crucial for the society's survival. Fire remained a symbol of strength and power, but it was also seen as a tool for communication and connection among the Garudans.

Garudan architecture evolved to include both igloo-like structures and more open-air designs, reflecting their desire to connect with the environment while also remaining protected. Their layered and practical fashion continued to be a reflection of their society's values, with each layer serving a specific purpose.

Despite their socialist economy, Garuda's laws remained capitalistic, causing tension within the society. This tension ultimately led to the downfall of Garuda as the society struggled to balance their values of equality and fairness with the desire for individual success.
