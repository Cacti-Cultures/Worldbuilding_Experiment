CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the Tusked Oni is quite vague and lacks specific details about their culture, religion, and way of life. It would be helpful to provide more information to better understand who they are and how they function as a society.
- The use of terms like "anarcho-capitalism" and "hierocracy" may not fit well in a low fantasy setting and could be confusing for readers. It may be best to simplify the language used to describe their social structure and economic system.
- The mention of their "xylophagous diets" seems out of place and does not add much to their characterization. It may be better to omit this detail or provide more context for why they have this dietary preference.

ACTION:
The Tusked Oni were a nomadic society that roamed the vast steppes, living in yurts made of animal skins and decorated with intricate symbols inspired by the towering mountains that surrounded them. They were a complex society that valued both tradition and progress, and their way of life was shaped by their devotion to their religion and their desire for economic gain.

Their religion was centered around the worship of the spirits of nature, and they believed that all living things were connected in a vast web of life. They had a deep respect for the natural world and were skilled at living off the land. However, they were not afraid to exploit it for economic gain and were skilled brewers who traded their alcohol with other societies.

Their social structure was hierarchical, with a council of elders who made decisions on behalf of the group. However, they were also known for their adventurous culture and open-mindedness, and individuals were free to pursue their own interests and passions. They had a strong sense of community and were fiercely protective of their tribe.

Their fashion changed with the seasons, with fur and leather being the preferred materials for their clothing. They spoke in a melodic language that was difficult for outsiders to understand, but they were welcoming to visitors who respected their way of life.

Overall, the Tusked Oni were a fascinating society of nomads who valued their traditions while embracing change and progress. Despite their aggressive conflicts, they had a deep respect for the natural world and their place in it.
