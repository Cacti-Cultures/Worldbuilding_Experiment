CONSIDERATIONS:
The scenario presents a stark contrast between the Yuki-onna and the Fanged society, but it does not explain why the Yuki-onna agreed to help the Fanged society, especially given their opposing beliefs and values. Additionally, the scenario could benefit from more worldbuilding details, such as the geography of the tundra and the history of the Fanged society. 

ACTION:
The Yuki-onna were initially hesitant to help the Fanged society, given their anarchic laws and fascist corporatism. However, they saw an opportunity to bring justice to the oppressed and to reduce suffering in the universe. They believed that by aiding the Fanged society, they could minimize the harm caused by their wars and potentially create a more peaceful society.

To ensure their safety, the Yuki-onna negotiated a fair treaty that would protect them from harm. They also established a system of checks and balances to prevent the Fanged society from turning on them. For example, the Yuki-onna agreed to only provide aid in defensive battles and to never participate in massacres or other violent acts.

Over time, the Yuki-onna's influence began to spread throughout the Fanged society. They taught the Fanged society about the principles of Taoism, which emphasized the balance between yin and yang and the importance of living in harmony with nature. Some Fanged society members began to adopt these beliefs, leading to a shift towards a more peaceful and just society.

As for the geography of the tundra, it was a harsh and unforgiving landscape, with freezing temperatures and fierce winds. The Yuki-onna were able to survive in this environment due to their wind-controlling abilities, which allowed them to create pockets of warmth and shelter. The Fanged society, on the other hand, had adapted to the tundra by developing thick fur and tough skin.

Overall, the Yuki-onna and the Fanged society were able to coexist and even thrive together, thanks to their mutual respect and cooperation. While their beliefs and values may have been different, they were able to find common ground and work towards a better future for all.
