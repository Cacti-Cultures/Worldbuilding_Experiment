CONSIDERATIONS:
- The scenario presents a significant shift in the culture and beliefs of the Orcs, but it would be helpful to understand the reasons behind this change. Was there an external influence, such as contact with a more advanced society, or did the Orcs come to these conclusions on their own?
- The mention of distributism as a new economic system is intriguing, but it would be beneficial to explain how it works in the context of Orc society. How is wealth distributed, and what are the implications of this system?
- The description of the Orcs as insectivorous could benefit from more detail. Are there specific insects they rely on for sustenance, or do they have a wide-ranging diet that includes insects?
- The idea of using nature for the greater good is a positive development, but it could be interesting to explore the consequences of these actions. What impact do these naturalistic structures have on the environment and wildlife in the area?
- The mention of a select few holding power in the society raises questions about who these individuals are and how they maintain their control. Are they religious leaders, military commanders, or something else entirely?

ACTION:
The Orcs of the Ashen society had long been isolated from the rest of the world, living a simple life of honor and ritual. But a chance encounter with a group of traders from a distant land brought new ideas and perspectives to the Orcs, sparking a revolution of thought and action.

At first, the Orcs were skeptical of these outsiders and their strange ways. But as they began to interact more, they saw the benefits of new technologies and economic systems. The concept of distributism, with its emphasis on communal ownership and fair distribution of resources, resonated with the Orcs' sense of honor and justice.

With the help of the traders, the Orcs began to experiment with new methods of agriculture, cultivating crops and herbs alongside their traditional insect-based diet. They also learned to harness the power of wind and water, building turbines and mills to power their homes and workshops.

As they incorporated these new ideas into their society, the Orcs also looked to their own traditions for inspiration. They saw the beauty in the natural world around them, and began to build structures that blended seamlessly into the mountainside. These structures not only provided shelter and protection, but also helped to regulate temperature and humidity, creating a comfortable and sustainable living environment.

The Orcs also recognized the power of language and storytelling, using their rhythmic language to spread ideas of change and progress. They drew inspiration from the hawk, a symbol of freedom and strength, and began to incorporate it into their art and architecture.

But not everyone was on board with these changes. The oligarchs who had long held power in the society saw their influence waning, and began to resist the new ideas. They spread fear and misinformation, claiming that the outsiders were trying to corrupt the Orcs and turn them away from their true path.

Despite these challenges, the Orcs remained committed to their vision of a just and equitable society. They knew that change would not come easily, but they were willing to fight for it. And with the help of those who believed in their cause, they would continue to push forward, towards a brighter future for all.
