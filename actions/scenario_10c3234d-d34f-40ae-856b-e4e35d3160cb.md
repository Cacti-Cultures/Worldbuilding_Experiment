ACTION:
In the wetlands of the snouted society, the harpies were known as formidable warriors who protected their territory with their advanced arcane technology. Their society was based on distributism, where resources were shared amongst the community, but their strict laws made them hesitant to share with neighboring communities. Despite their reputation for being fierce protectors, the harpies were also known for their spontaneous celebrations of pagan rituals during the full moon, where they would dance and sing under the moonlight. 

The harpies' arcane technology was powered by a unique type of crystal found deep in the wetlands. The crystals gave the harpies the ability to control the elements and manipulate energy to power their advanced technology. The harpies were fiercely protective of their crystals and would go to great lengths to safeguard them from outsiders. 

The harpies' society was structured as a technocracy, where those with knowledge of the arcane held the most power. They valued liberty and individualism, but their conflicts with neighboring communities often required them to appease their enemies rather than fight them. The harpies' invasion of neighboring communities stemmed from their need for resources to sustain their growing population and their desire to expand their arcane knowledge. 

During the full moon, the harpies would gather in their towering skyscrapers to celebrate their pagan rituals. The rituals were a way for them to connect with their ancient heritage and pay homage to the moon goddess. They would wear masks and dance around a large bonfire, chanting in their tonal language. 

Overall, the harpies were a complex society with a rich culture and advanced technology. Despite their protective nature, their conflicts with neighboring communities often led to fear and mistrust.
