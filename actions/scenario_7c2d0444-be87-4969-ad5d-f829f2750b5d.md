CONSIDERATIONS:
- The cause of the plague could be explained more clearly to provide clarity in the story.
- The cannibalistic diets could be better explained as it seems to be a drastic action to take for survival.
- The division within the society could be more fleshed out to provide more depth and understanding of the conflict.
- The use of iron age technology could be expanded on to better understand how the Aos Si people defend themselves.

ACTION:
In the caverns of the Aos Si, an ancient ghostly society, the hierocracy of the monarchic laws is upheld by the considerate builders who construct the ornate cliffside dwellings. The Aos Si people practice a conservationist culture, deeply rooted in spiritualism, and they revere the mountain as a symbol of their beliefs. Their language is harmonic and their religion is entwined with nature, which is parasitic and prone to conflict. A mysterious disease has swept through the Aos Si community, causing its members to fall ill and die. The cause of the plague is unknown, but rumors swirl that it is a curse from the spirits of the mountain that the Aos Si people have angered by their overuse of the land. 

As the disease spreads, the Aos Si society becomes more divided. Some members turn to cannibalism, believing it to be the only way to survive. Others refuse to resort to such drastic measures, instead turning to their religious beliefs for guidance. The divide between the two groups grows wider, with those who have turned to cannibalism being ostracized by the rest of the community. 

In a desperate attempt to save their society, the Aos Si people turn to their iron age technology to defend themselves against the disease and any other threats that may come their way. They begin to mine deeper into the mountain, hoping to find new resources to help them survive. 

Despite their efforts, the Aos Si society continues to struggle. The tension between those who have turned to cannibalism and those who have not grows more intense, with violence erupting between the two groups. The society is on the brink of collapse, with some members pushing for change and others seeking to maintain the old ways. The Aos Si people must find a way to come together and overcome their differences in order to survive in their harsh environment.
