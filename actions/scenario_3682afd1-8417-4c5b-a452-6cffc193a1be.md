CONSIDERATIONS:
- It is unclear what the parasitic creatures invading the kingdom were and how they affected the merfolk's way of life. Providing more information on this would enhance the worldbuilding.
- While the taboo topic of cannibalistic diets adds an interesting layer to the merfolk's society, it may be important to explore how this affects the merfolk's relationships with neighboring kingdoms or other species in the world.
- The use of a dragon symbol in hillside dwellings is intriguing, but it is not clear if dragons actually exist in this world or if they are simply a cultural symbol. Clarifying this would add to the depth of the worldbuilding.

ACTION:
The merfolk's kingdom was once a peaceful and prosperous place, ruled by a just and fair monarchy. However, that all changed when the kingdom was invaded by a swarm of parasitic creatures from the deep sea. The creatures were unlike anything the merfolk had ever seen before, with razor-sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for the merfolk's flesh. The invasion plunged the kingdom into a dark age, as the merfolk struggled to fight off the invaders and rebuild their shattered society.

As the merfolk began to rebuild, they turned to innovation and invention to help them survive in the harsh new world. Their industrial tech was put to use in creating pottery, which soon became highly sought after by neighboring kingdoms. However, even as they prospered, whispers of insincere dealings among the nobles began to spread.

The merfolk's religion was one of dualism, where the sea and land were seen as equally important. However, the taboo topic of cannibalistic diets was also an essential part of their ecosystem. While some merfolk frowned upon the practice, others saw it as a necessary evil in order to survive in a world where food was scarce.

The dragon was a symbol of power and strength in merfolk society, often used in hillside dwellings that overlooked the kingdom. However, the dragons were not mere symbols - they actually existed in this world, and were revered by the merfolk for their wisdom and strength.

The merfolk's language was staccato, and their fashion consisted of intricately beaded accessories. The laws of their society were anarchic, with conflicts often resolved through negotiation. The occupation of a potter was highly respected in their society, as pottery was seen as a symbol of the merfolk's ingenuity and resilience in the face of adversity.
