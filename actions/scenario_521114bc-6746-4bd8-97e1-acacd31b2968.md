CONSIDERATIONS: 

- The description of the ghouls' religion and their understanding of nature is vague and could benefit from more detail. 
- The emphasis on the importance of fishing and folivorous diets seems out of place for a society of ghouls, who are typically associated with consuming flesh. 
- It would be interesting to explore the conflicts and negotiations with neighboring clans in more detail to add depth to the worldbuilding. 

ACTION: 

In the highlands of the necrocracy, a polished society of ghouls lived under a polytheistic religion. They believed that the world was created by a pantheon of deities who controlled the forces of nature, though their understanding of these forces was often limited. Despite this, they were enthusiastic about adventure and the exploration of new lands, driven by a desire to uncover the mysteries of the world. 

The exodus of their people to new territories was a common event, but it was not always peaceful. Negotiations with neighboring clans were frequent conflicts, as the ghouls were often seen as a threat to the established order. The ghouls themselves were immodest in their pursuit of wealth and power, embracing a corporatist economy where trade and commerce were highly valued. 

The architecture of their fortified cities was inspired by the powerful symbol of the dragon, which they believed represented strength and resilience. Their language was beautifully rhythmic, embroidered with ancient stories of heroic deeds and epic battles. 

The laws of the community were communal, with a strong emphasis on fairness and equality. However, there were always those who sought to exploit the system for their own gain, leading to occasional bouts of corruption and deceit. 

In this renaissance era, technology was advancing rapidly, but the ghouls remained grounded in their traditions. They valued the art of embroidery and the skill of fishing, but also recognized the importance of innovation and progress. 

As for their diet, while they did consume flesh, they also recognized the value of a varied diet. They were known to cultivate their own crops and to fish in the nearby rivers and streams. This led to a unique culinary culture, where dishes were often infused with herbs and spices to create bold and flavorful meals. 

Overall, the ghouls were a complex and fascinating society, driven by a desire for knowledge and adventure, but also tempered by their traditions and values.
