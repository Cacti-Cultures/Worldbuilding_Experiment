CONSIDERATIONS:
- While the Salamanders' rejection of technology and tools is an interesting aspect of their culture, it might be helpful to explain why they hold this belief. Is it a religious or philosophical belief? Is it a result of a traumatic event in their history? Providing more context could make the culture more believable and relatable to readers.
- The sudden invasion by a neighboring tribe seems to come out of nowhere and is not fully explained. It might be helpful to provide more information about the relationship between the Salamanders and their neighbors, and why the invasion occurred. This would add depth to the story and make it more engaging for readers.
- The socialist nature of the Salamanders' society is mentioned but not fully explored. It might be interesting to delve deeper into how this system works and how it affects the daily lives of the Salamanders. 

ACTION:
The Salamanders are an intriguing culture, but I believe that they could benefit from some additional worldbuilding to make them more fully fleshed out. With this in mind, I would like to add the following details:

- The Salamanders' rejection of technology and tools is a result of a religious belief that venerates simplicity and self-sufficiency. They believe that relying too heavily on outside technologies will weaken their community and make them vulnerable to corruption and greed. This belief is reinforced by a story from their religious texts about a neighboring tribe that became too reliant on machines and ultimately destroyed themselves in a catastrophic explosion.

- The invasion by the neighboring tribe occurred because of a long-standing conflict over resources. The Salamanders' bayou is rich in valuable minerals and herbs, and their neighbors had been coveting these resources for years. When the Salamanders refused to share their wealth, the neighboring tribe decided to launch a surprise attack.

- The Salamanders' socialist society is based on the principle of mutual aid. Everyone in the community is expected to contribute to the common good, and in return, they are guaranteed access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. The community is governed by a council of elders who are elected by the people and who serve for life. 

With these additions, the Salamanders become a more complex and interesting culture, with a rich history and a compelling belief system. The conflict with their neighbors is given more depth and nuance, making it a more engaging part of the story. And the socialist nature of their society is more fully explored, giving readers a better understanding of how the Salamanders live and work together.
