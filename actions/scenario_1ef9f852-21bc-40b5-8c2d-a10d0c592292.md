ACTION:
In the sprawling underwater city of the Fae, life was divided by clan, with each group of brawny creatures fiercely protective of their own. Despite the discordant relationships between the clans, it was considered gracious to show respect and deference to those of higher status. The Fae were a scholarly people, with a polytheistic religion and a feudal economic system. 

Their diet consisted of the blood of large, deep-sea creatures that they hunted with their sharp teeth and claws. They would often go on hunting expeditions, using their agility and speed to outmaneuver their prey. 

The Fae's technology was medieval at best, relying on weapons such as tridents and harpoons to defend themselves against threats. They communicated through a sibilant language that was hiss-like in nature, often punctuated by sharp clicks that were unique to their culture. Their modes of transportation were limited to swimming and riding on the backs of giant sea turtles that they trained from birth.

Laws were autocratic and enforced through fear, with those who broke them facing severe consequences. The Fae had a complex system of artisan occupations, with each clan specializing in a particular craft. Their symbols were often represented by ravens, which they believed to be a symbol of intelligence and wisdom.

Fashion was status-oriented, with ornate and intricate designs reserved for the highest-ranking members of society. Despite the constant threat of war, the Fae continued to thrive in their underwater city, relying on their strong sense of clan loyalty to survive.

With these additions, readers can now visualize the Fae's daily life, including their hunting habits, their modes of transportation, and their unique language. The expanded description of their technology and artisan occupations also gives readers a better sense of their culture and way of life.
