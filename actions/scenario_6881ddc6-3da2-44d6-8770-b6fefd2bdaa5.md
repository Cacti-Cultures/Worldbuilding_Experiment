CONSIDERATIONS: 

- The description of the mandrakes' language as "guttural" is vague and could benefit from further explanation. Does it have any unique features or characteristics that set it apart from other fantasy languages?
- It is unclear what kind of conflicts the mandrakes are always on the brink of due to their love of subterfuge. Providing more specific details on this could add depth to their society and make it more interesting.
- While the mandrakes' underwater city is mentioned as their greatest masterpiece, no other details are provided about it. Adding more information about the city and how it was built could make it a more compelling aspect of their culture.

ACTION: 

The mandrakes were a society that lived in the heptarchy of canyons, where the landscape was as vibrant as their culture. They were known for their folivorous diets, and their shaman were dependable healers who used theism and subterfuge to cure their people. The mandrakes were fiercely independent and had a matrilineal law system. They had a love for decorative fashion, ornate architecture, and their greatest masterpiece was an underwater city called Xanthea, built during their renaissance era. 

Xanthea was a city unlike any other, with towering spires made from coral and stone, and an intricate network of canals and tunnels that allowed the mandrakes to travel quickly and easily throughout the city. It was built using a combination of magic and engineering, with the mandrakes harnessing the power of the sea to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that provided everything they needed to thrive. 

Despite their ignorance of the outside world, the mandrakes were a communalist society that valued their independence above everything else. Their language was unique, with a series of clicks and pops that mimicked the sounds of the canyons they called home. However, their society was also unstable, and the mandrakes were always on the brink of conflict due to their love of subterfuge. They were known to engage in complex political maneuvering, with each family vying for power and influence over the others. 

The mandrakes' shaman continued to heal their people with their knowledge of the natural world, using herbs and potions to cure illnesses and injuries. They were also skilled in the art of divination, using their connection to the spirit world to predict the future and guide their people through difficult times. Despite their many flaws, the mandrakes remained a proud and resilient society, fiercely loyal to their way of life and their underwater city of Xanthea.
