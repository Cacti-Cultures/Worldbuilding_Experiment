CONSIDERATIONS:
- The economic system of the Norns is not sustainable and needs further explanation. How can it be improved or changed to make it more functional?
- The relationship of the Norns with nature is contradictory to their monotheistic beliefs. Can this be reconciled or explored further?
- The revolution brewing needs more context. Who are the revolutionaries and what are their demands? How did the Norns get to this point?

ACTION:
The Norns were a proud and honorable people, but their economic system was in dire need of reform. They saw that their barter-based system was hindering their prosperity and preventing them from reaching their full potential. In an effort to improve their economy, the Norns began to explore other means of trade, such as using precious metals and gems as currency. They also began to trade with neighboring societies, which helped to diversify their economy and bring in new goods and resources.

As the Norns worked to improve their economic situation, they also began to reflect on their relationship with nature. They realized that their exploitative practices were not in line with their monotheistic beliefs, and they began to make amends. They stopped hunting for sport and began to farm and cultivate the land instead. They also began to use geothermal energy more efficiently, reducing their impact on the environment.

Despite these positive changes, a revolution was brewing. The revolutionaries were a group of young Norns who were disillusioned with the ergatocracy and oligarchic law system. They believed that power should be distributed more equally and that the Norns needed to move away from their traditional ways of doing things. The Norns were faced with a difficult choice: to capitulate to the demands of the revolutionaries or to face the consequences.

In the end, the Norns chose to listen to the revolutionaries and make changes to their society. They implemented a more democratic system of government and worked to address the concerns of the revolutionaries. While it was a difficult transition, the Norns ultimately emerged stronger and more prosperous than ever before. They continued to honor their traditions and monotheistic beliefs, but they also recognized that change was necessary for growth and progress.
