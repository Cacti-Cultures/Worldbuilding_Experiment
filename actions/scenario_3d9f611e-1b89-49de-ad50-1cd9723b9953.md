CONSIDERATIONS:
- The origin story of the wights is not explained, which could add more depth to their culture.
- It is unclear how the wights interact with other species in the nurturing nature around them.
- The mention of market socialism seems out of place in a low fantasy setting and could be explained more seamlessly.
- The concept of minarchism may need further explanation for readers who are unfamiliar with it.
- The wights' unobservant nature causing conflicts could be expanded upon to make it more relevant to the story.

ACTION:
The wights' origin story is rooted in an ancient legend that tells of a great serpent that slithered through the glaciers, creating the underground caverns that the wights would eventually call home. According to the legend, the serpent was a gift from the gods, a symbol of their protection and guidance. From the serpent's scales, the wights learned to craft their armor, and from its venom, they discovered the power of their sacred symbol.

The wights' hematophagous nature made them feared and shunned by other species, but they had a deep respect for the nurturing nature around them. They believed that the animals they hunted were gifts from the gods, and they performed elaborate rituals to honor and thank them for providing sustenance. In times of drought or famine, the wights would seek out the guidance of the serpent, who they believed could communicate with the gods.

The wights' economy was based on a system of bartering, with gatherers trading goods in the market. However, the market was regulated by a council of elders, who ensured that trade was fair and equitable. This system was called "market socialism" by outsiders, but to the wights, it was simply the way things were done.

The wights' minarchist government was led by a council of elders, who were chosen based on their wisdom and experience. They acted as mediators in disputes and were responsible for making decisions that affected the entire community. The wights' unobservant nature often caused conflicts within the community, but the elders were skilled at resolving them and maintaining harmony.

In times of crisis, the wights came together to work towards a common goal. During the exodus, the council of elders organized the evacuation, ensuring that everyone was able to make the journey safely. The wights relied on their medieval technology, but they were resourceful and made the best of what they had.

Overall, these changes add more depth to the wights' culture and provide a clearer picture of their society. The origin story, belief system, and economy are all more fully developed, which makes the wights feel more like a real, fleshed-out species.
