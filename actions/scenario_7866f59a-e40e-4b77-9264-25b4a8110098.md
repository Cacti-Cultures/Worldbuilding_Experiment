CONSIDERATIONS:
- The description of the Aristocracy's society is intriguing, but there is little detail on the plague that is affecting them. It would be beneficial to provide more information on the plague, such as its symptoms, how it spreads, and how it is affecting the people.
- The society's reliance on a detritivorous diet could be explained more thoroughly. It is unclear what types of detritus they consume and how they prepare it.
- The Bronze Age level of technology seems out of place in a society that has a religion based on Druidism. It would be worth considering if there are any magical or supernatural elements to their society that could explain their limited technology.
- More information could be provided on the symbolic fashion of the Aristocracy. What do the different colors and styles represent? How do they change based on status?

ACTION:
The icy land of the Aristocracy was plagued by a mysterious illness that caused its victims to suffer from intense fever and coughing fits. It was transmitted through contact with bodily fluids and was highly contagious. The people of the Aristocracy struggled to adapt to the outbreak, as their laws and customs made it difficult to quickly respond to the needs of the sick. Builders were essential to constructing new dwellings for the afflicted, but the inflexible laws of the monarchic society made it difficult to mobilize them in time.

To combat the plague, the people turned to their religious beliefs in Druidism. They believed that the willow tree held the power to heal the sick and would perform rituals to appease the spirits of the land. The society's reliance on a detritivorous diet allowed them to survive during the crisis, as they could easily find sustenance in the decaying matter left behind by the sick.

Despite their limited technology, the people of the Aristocracy discovered that certain herbs and roots had medicinal properties that could ease the symptoms of the plague. They also developed a crude form of quarantine, isolating the sick in cliffside dwellings to prevent the spread of the disease.

Fashion became highly symbolic during this time, with certain colors and styles representing different stages of the illness. Red was worn by those who had contracted the disease, while green represented those who were healthy. Patterns of swirls and lines were used to signify the severity of the illness.

As the plague began to subside, the people of the Aristocracy reflected on the lessons learned during the crisis. They recognized the need for more flexibility in their laws and customs and vowed to work towards a more adaptable society. The Druidic practices that had helped them through the crisis became more widely accepted, and the society developed a greater appreciation for the healing power of nature.
