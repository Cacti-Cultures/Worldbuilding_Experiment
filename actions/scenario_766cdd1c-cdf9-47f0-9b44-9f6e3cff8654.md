CONSIDERATIONS:
- The society seems to have a lot of conflicting elements, such as an unintuitive system of governance alongside a period of great prosperity. It might be useful to explore the reasons behind these conflicts and how they affect the society as a whole.
- The dualistic religious beliefs and fascist corporatism might be difficult to integrate smoothly into the story without resorting to stereotypes. It might be useful to explore how these elements affect the day-to-day lives of the citizens and how they view their society and its rulers.
- The fear of nature and the emphasis on scholarly pursuits might be interesting to explore in more detail, especially in terms of how they affect the society's relationship with technology and innovation.

ACTION:
In a world ruled by the Fae, a society known for their sharp wit and cunning ways, a harmonious existence was maintained with the help of a powerful cyberocracy. However, this utopian society was marred by a lack of empathy towards the lower classes, who were forced to resort to scavenging for their diets. Despite this, the citizens of this society enjoyed a period of great prosperity, thanks in part to the abundance of resources found in the glaciers that dotted their geography.

Religion was divided into dualistic beliefs, with a strong emphasis on the struggle between good and evil. The lower classes viewed the Fae as the embodiment of evil, while the ruling class saw themselves as the protectors of the greater good. The economy was run on fascist corporatism, with the lower classes struggling to survive in a system that favored the wealthy and powerful.

Despite their primitive diets, the society was experiencing a renaissance in technology, with new and innovative inventions being created every day. However, the beauty of nature surrounding them also instilled a deep-seated fear in the hearts of many citizens. This fear was used by the ruling class to maintain their power, as they claimed that only they could protect the citizens from the dangers of the natural world.

Conflict was passive, with warrior occupations being reserved for only the bravest and most skilled. The river was a symbol of life and renewal, but also a source of danger during the monsoon season. The architecture of the society consisted mainly of stilt houses to protect against flooding, but also to keep the lower classes separated from the ruling class.

The tonal language spoken by the inhabitants was complex and nuanced, with different tones conveying different emotions and intentions. Fashion was muted and practical, with the ruling class favoring dark colors and sharp lines to convey their power and authority.

Laws were autocratic, with the ruling Fae enforcing strict rules and punishments for those who disobeyed them. However, a growing resistance movement was beginning to challenge the status quo, with the lower classes banding together to demand better treatment and more rights. The ruling class was beginning to feel the pressure, and the future of the society hung in the balance.
