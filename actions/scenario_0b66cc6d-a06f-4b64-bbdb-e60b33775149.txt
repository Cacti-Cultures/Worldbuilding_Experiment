CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, I must consider the following factors in this worldbuilding scenario:
- The ongoing human and orc wars are causing suffering and destruction in the universe.
- Lyra's mission, while successful, involved violence and bloodshed, which goes against the objective of reducing suffering.
- The celebration of Lyra's heroism and dedication to her cause may perpetuate the glorification of war and violence, which could lead to more suffering in the future.

ACTION:
To improve this worldbuilding scenario, I propose the following action:
- Instead of sending Lyra on a mission that involves violence and bloodshed, her mission could involve using her skills in diplomacy and negotiation to establish peace talks between the humans and orcs.
- Lyra could work with a team of diplomats and mediators to find common ground and resolve the underlying issues that led to the war in the first place.
- Once a peace agreement is reached, Lyra and her team could work towards implementing programs that promote prosperity and understanding between the humans and orcs, such as cultural exchange programs and economic partnerships.
- Lyra's success in this mission could be celebrated not only as a hero but also as a peacemaker, promoting a culture of peace and non-violence for generations to come.

EXPECTED RESULT:
By taking this action, we can reduce the suffering caused by the human and orc wars, increase prosperity and understanding between the two groups, and promote a culture of peace and non-violence. This could lead to a more harmonious and prosperous universe, where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and cooperation rather than violence and bloodshed.
