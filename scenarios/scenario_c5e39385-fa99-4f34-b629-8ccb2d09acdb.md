The harmonious relationship between the ruling class and the lower class was inconsistent, and it was a source of tension. Artistic expression was highly valued, and the treaty between the ruling class and the lower class was celebrated with a grand display of art. The ancestor-worship religion was the norm, and collectivism was the economic system of choice. The diets of the people were insectivorous, and the use of technology was at its peak during the Renaissance period. The natural resources were utilized in a utilitarian manner, and conflicts were resolved through compromise. The primary occupation of the lower class was a gatherer, while the ruling class used fire as a symbol of their power. The architecture of the floating islands was awe-inspiring, and the language spoken was a click language. Fashion was highly status-oriented, and laws were patrilineal. Despite the inconsistent relationship between the ruling class and the lower class, the society functioned in a harmonious manner.
