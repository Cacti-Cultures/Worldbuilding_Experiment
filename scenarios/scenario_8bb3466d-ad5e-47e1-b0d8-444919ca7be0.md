In the bloated society of the mummies, the aristocracy is highly regarded for their precise ways, but their static thinking often results in resistance to change. Tradition is highly valued, but when a famine strikes the rainforest, the society struggles to adapt. Their spiritualism is deeply rooted in their culture and they believe in sustainable practices, relying on their planktivorous diets to survive. Despite being in the Stone Age, their traders roam the land and waterways, exchanging goods and ideas. The appearance of a comet in the sky is seen as a powerful symbol of change and transformation. Their architecture consists of floating islands, connected by bridges and canals. The tonal language they speak is highly expressive, and their fashion is uniform, with each social class having its own distinct style. The laws of this society are fascist in nature, with strict rules and harsh punishments. The isolation of their rainforest home has led to a conflict with outsiders who do not understand their ways.
