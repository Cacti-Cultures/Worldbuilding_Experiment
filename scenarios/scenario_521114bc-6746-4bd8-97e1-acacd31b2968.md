In the highlands of the necrocracy, a polished society of ghouls lived under a polytheistic religion. Despite their ignorant understanding of nature, they were enthusiastic about adventure and the exploration of new lands. The exodus of their people to new territories was a common event, and negotiations with neighboring clans were frequent conflicts. The ghouls were immodest in their pursuit of wealth and power, embracing a corporatist economy where fishers were highly valued for their folivorous diets. The architecture of their fortified cities was inspired by the powerful symbol of the dragon, and their language was beautifully rhythmic, embroidered with ancient stories of heroic deeds. The laws of the community were communal, with a strong emphasis on fairness and equality. In this renaissance era, technology was advancing rapidly, but the ghouls remained grounded in their traditions, valuing the art of embroidery and the skill of fishing above all else.
