The Kodama clan, inhabitants of the Multicolored society in the Rift Valley, were a stoic people, determined to survive in the dominant, carnivorous nature that surrounded them. Their society was based on barter and their economy relied heavily on the skills of their tanners, who crafted ornate clothing and leather goods. Their language was agglutinative and their architecture consisted of cave dwellings adorned with symbols of the rose, a sacred symbol in their pagan religion. The Kodama people lived in the Bronze Age, relying on simple technology to get by. However, their lack of intuition made it difficult for them to adapt to new situations, which was evident during an invasion by a neighboring tribe. Despite the conflict, the Kodama people were determined to reconcile with their enemies and maintain their socialist laws.
