Once upon a time, in a serene and sturdy society, there lived a group of scholarly rakshasas in their vexiarchy. These rakshasas lived in hillside dwellings in the taiga region and followed animism as their religion. They were known for their hematophagous diet and their primordial technology.

The rakshasas lived in a coexistent nature with the other creatures of the taiga. They were farmers who followed the syndicalism economic model and believed in egalitarian laws. However, their society was inconsistent, and their events were often marred by drought.

To combat this issue, the rakshasas developed a unique way of coercion to control the weather. They believed that the stars were the key to controlling the weather, and they developed a uniform fashion that incorporated star symbols to help them connect with the stars.

The rakshasas spoke in a verb-less language that only they could understand, and they were deeply committed to their coexistent nature. They believed that all creatures in the taiga were equal and deserved to live in peace.

Despite their scholarly culture and peaceful ways, the rakshasas were often misunderstood by outsiders who feared their hematophagous diet and their unique way of life. However, the rakshasas remained steadfast in their beliefs and continued to thrive in their society, hoping to one day be understood by others.
