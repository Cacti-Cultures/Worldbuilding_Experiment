In the vast steppes of the land, the society of the graceful Tsukumogami prospered through their innovative participatory economics. They were known for their fearless warriors who adorned themselves in beaded attire and carried symbols of ravens, a sacred bird in their shamanistic religion. The society was ruled by a kraterocracy, with each member holding equal power in decision-making. However, their language was isolating which made it difficult to communicate with other neighboring communities. Despite their medieval technology, they were able to build impressive dome-shaped architecture, which served as a place for religious worship. Although they were oophagous, their theocratic laws forbade the killing of any living creature, leading to a peaceful coexistence with nature. Conflict avoidance was highly valued, but when it was necessary, their warriors were unafraid to protect their people. However, their creativity was often hindered by their tendency to be unoriginal, leading to a lack of diversity in their art and culture. Nevertheless, their society thrived, and their prosperity continued for generations.
