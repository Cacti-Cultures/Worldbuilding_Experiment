In the wetlands of the Krakens, a tattered society of feudal lords struggled to maintain their hold on power during the Golden Age of innovation. While determined to preserve their way of life, the immodest nobles often clashed with one another, disrupting the delicate balance of power. Despite their differences, the Krakens remained sustainable, with their planktivorous diet and reliance on arcane technology. Conflict was often resolved through compromise, as the society adhered to an anarchic legal system. The Krakens were agnostic, with no formal religion dictating their way of life. The farmers who tended to the land were essential to the Krakens' survival, living in cliffside dwellings and adorned in beaded fashion. The rose was a symbol of love and unity among the people, who spoke a unique verb-less language. Despite their unique way of life, the Krakens thrived under anarcho-capitalism, allowing for innovation and progress.
