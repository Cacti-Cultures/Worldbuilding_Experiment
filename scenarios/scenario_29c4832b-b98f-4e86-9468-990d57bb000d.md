In the veined society of the Rift Valley, the people lived in a feudal system ruled by warlords who were respected for their strength and prowess in battle. However, the society was plagued by a parasitic virus that turned people into zombies, and the warlords were often more concerned with avoiding conflict with the zombies than with each other.

Despite their incurious nature, a group of adventurers set out to explore the valley and find a solution to the zombie virus. They traveled to the crystal palace, a magnificent structure built by the theistic leaders of the past, hoping to find clues in the ancient texts.

Along the way, they encountered scavengers who survived by eating the zombies and spoke a harmonic language that was almost musical. They also came across a blacksmith who had developed stone age technology that could be used to fight the zombies.

As they journeyed through the valley, they witnessed a flood that swept through the land and destroyed many of the warlord's castles. The flood brought a sense of collectivism to the people, who banded together to help each other.

The adventurers eventually discovered a symbol of hope in the form of a lone wolf who had somehow developed an immunity to the zombie virus. They brought the wolf back to their village, where the people began to revere it as a sacred animal.

The society was patrilineal, and the warlords' descendants inherited their positions of power. However, the wolf's arrival sparked a change in the culture, and the people began to value the wolf's resilience and adaptability over the warlords' strength.

The adventurers worked with the blacksmith to develop weapons made from the wolf's bones, and they trained the people to fight the zombies. Slowly but surely, the society began to turn the tide against the zombie virus, and the people looked forward to a future free from the constant threat of the undead.
