Deep in the heart of the Taiga, the Kappas of the Monochrome Society thrived under their Theocracy. Though they were known to be dependable, their culture was one of discipline, sometimes bordering on dullness. They lived off a nectarivorous diet and practiced ancestor-worship as their religion. Their economy revolved around gift-giving, and their technology was in the midst of a renaissance. However, their nature was also destructive, and conflicts were resolved through negotiation. The primary occupation was mining, and their architecture was dominated by treehouses, with oak being a significant symbol. The Kappas had a minimalistic sense of fashion, and their language was guttural. Their laws were tribal and enforced with discipline. Recently, the Kappas experienced an awakening, and they were beginning to question their ways, wondering if there was more to life than just following their ancestors' footsteps.
