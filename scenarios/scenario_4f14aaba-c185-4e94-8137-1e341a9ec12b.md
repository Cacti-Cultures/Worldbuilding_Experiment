In the misty wetlands of Yokai, a society of stoic herbivorous farmers lived in simple cliffside dwellings, adorned with decorative symbols of the phoenix. Despite their egalitarian laws, the society was rigid and dull, with a phylarchy system in place. The religion of asceticism prevailed, and the economy was focused on conservationist practices for a green future. The language spoken was sibilant, and the fashion was ornate and decorative. Despite the fair treatment of all members of society, subterfuge was common in their daily lives, and the industrial technology was used to further the cause of enlightenment. The society's positive attributes included a strong commitment to fairness and environmentalism, but the negative aspects included a lack of creativity and innovation.
