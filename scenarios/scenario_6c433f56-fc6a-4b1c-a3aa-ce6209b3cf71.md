In the tundra of the quilled society, the wise shamans were the only ones who knew the true nature of the tsukumogami. The society was a plutocracy, with the wealthiest families controlling the majority of resources. Due to the communalism economics, the people were frugivorous and lived in hillside dwellings made of ice and stone. The wind was their primary source of energy, and they used it to power their beaded clothing, which was adorned with symbols of the stars. Despite their stoic culture and pantheistic religion, the people were often manipulated by the dark age they lived in. The click language they used was often dull and lacked the depth needed to express their emotions. Their laws were patrilineal, and capitulation was the only option for those who dared to challenge the status quo. Despite this, the shamans remained wise and used their knowledge to guide the society through the challenges they faced.
