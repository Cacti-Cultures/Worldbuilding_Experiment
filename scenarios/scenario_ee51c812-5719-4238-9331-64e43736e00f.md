In the badlands, where the wind was a constant companion and the stars shone brighter than anywhere else, the luminescent gargoyles made their home. They lived in a democracy, where agility was highly valued, and kinship was the foundation of their culture. 

Every few years, the gargoyles would migrate to new territories, guided by the stars and their hieroglyphic language. They were a market socialist society, with a strong focus on sustainability and wind technology. 

Despite being carnivorous, the gargoyles never took more from nature than they needed, and their asceticism was reflected in their fashion, which was vibrant, yet practical. 

Their fort-like architecture provided shelter and protection for their matrilineal society, who worked primarily as miners. The symbols of stars were woven into their daily lives, from the hieroglyphics they used to communicate to the vibrant clothing they wore. 

Conflict was rare among the gargoyles, who were generally indifferent to outsiders, but would defend their kinship fiercely if threatened. Their passive nature meant that they often avoided conflict altogether. 

Overall, the luminescent gargoyles were a fascinating society, with their unique blend of democracy, kinship, sustainable practices, and market socialism.
