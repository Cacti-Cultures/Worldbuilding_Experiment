In the icy steppes of the north, the Sturdy people lived a disciplined and collective lifestyle, guided by their theistic beliefs and spiritual practices. They worshiped the protective Yuki-onna spirit, who was said to guard them from the harshness of the cataclysmic blizzards that raged across their lands. The Sturdy people were a society of warriors, aggressive in their approach to conflict, and their laws were anarchic, as they believed in the power of individual responsibility. Their architecture consisted of minimalistic yurts, and their fashion was similarly simple. They were oophagous, subsisting on the eggs of the hardy creatures that managed to survive in the unforgiving terrain. Despite their primordial technology, the Sturdy people were able to thrive in their green economy, using the stars as their guide and their rhythmic language to communicate with each other. While some outsiders may view their way of life as dull, the Sturdy people found beauty and meaning in their disciplined existence, and they were proud of their heritage.
