In the grotto of the bulbous Tengu society, a drought had struck their land, causing panic and desperation among the nectarivorous creatures. In this alphatocracy ruled by a rigid and fascist corporatism, the Tengu who held power were fearless in their pursuit of absolute control. Despite the chaos that ensued, the Tengu held strong to their cultural values of loyalty to their leaders and shamanistic religion. The Tengu relied heavily on geothermal technology to sustain their floating islands, which were adorned with ritualistic architecture and the symbol of the rose. The Tengu language was vowel-heavy, and their laws were fascist, with little room for absolution. Scribes worked tirelessly to document the events of the drought, hoping to find a solution to the crisis. However, the nurturing nature of the Tengu prevailed, and they continued to support one another through the difficult times, even in the face of their oppressive government.
