In the heart of the dense rainforest, the Kodama society thrived. They were a tentacled species, with an ornate fashion sense that matched their melodic language. Despite being a kraterocracy, they were known for their generosity towards one another, practicing mutualism in their economic system. Their culture was highly industrious, with occupations ranging from fishers to bronze age metallurgists. Their religion was rooted in paganism, and they held the rose as a symbol of enlightenment. However, their laws were fascist, which often led to conflict and appeasement. The Kodama were granivorous, surviving on a diet of grains and other plant-based foods. They lived in burrow-like structures and were highly skilled in navigating the indifferent nature that surrounded them. Despite being competent in their respective trades, some Kodama were known to be incompetent in their roles, which caused tension within the society. Despite this, they remained united, constantly striving for progress and enlightenment.
