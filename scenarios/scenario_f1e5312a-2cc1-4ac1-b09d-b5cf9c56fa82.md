The Frosted ifrits, a noble hagiocracy, were a deeply spiritual society that lived amongst the coral reefs. Their religion was rooted in Taoism, and they followed a planktivorous diet. The ifrits believed in a gift economy, and their use of wind technology was coexistent with the environment. They were a status-oriented society, with tanners being highly respected in their community. The ifrits' architecture was characterized by towering skyscrapers, and their language was a unique click language. Their laws were socialist in nature, and conflict was resolved through adaptation. However, the ifrits had a wasteful tendency, which led to their migration as the coral reefs began to suffer. Despite this, the ifrits held fire as a symbol of their culture and continued to practice their spirituality in their new environment.
