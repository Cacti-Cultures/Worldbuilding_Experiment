In the spiraled society of the Naiads, bureaucracy was harmonious, with everyone working together towards a common goal. However, during a recent drought that swept across their archipelago, tensions began to rise, and the society became discordant. Despite their artistic culture and deistic beliefs, the Naiads struggled to maintain their green economy, relying on their oophagous diets and arcane technology to survive. The indifferent nature of the storm gods only added to the isolation felt by the farmers, who struggled to keep their crops alive. In their underwater city, built with functional architecture, the Naiads spoke an isolating language and followed monarchic laws. The symbol of the storm loomed over them, a constant reminder of their vulnerability. Despite their struggles, however, the Naiads remained resilient, determined to weather the storm and emerge stronger than ever before.
