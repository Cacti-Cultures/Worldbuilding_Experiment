In the badlands of the Basilisk society, the massive population is divided by a plutocracy. Despite this, the society is loving and conservation is highly valued. However, their culture is unoriginal and their technology is only at the Bronze Age level. The Basilisks survive on a scavenger diet and their architecture consists of hillside dwellings. Conflict is combative, and the only occupation available to the Basilisks is that of gatherer. Their religion is iconoclasm, and their language consists of sign language. The symbols of the society are mountains and their fashion is highly symbolic. Despite their egalitarian laws, there is a growing revolution among the Basilisks who seek a move towards socialism to improve their economic conditions. However, their nature is parasitic and their society struggles to find a balance between conservation and their own survival.
