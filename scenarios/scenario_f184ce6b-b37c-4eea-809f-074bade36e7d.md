In the kingdom of Iridescent, the residents were well-disciplined, creative, and symbiotic until the reformation event occurred. Suddenly, the marshlands were filled with zombies, who were inconsiderate and focused on retribution. The economy shifted towards corporatism, as the iron age technology was not enough to combat the zombie invasion. The only viable occupation was fishing in the mountain rivers, as the xylophagous diet was no longer sustainable. The architecture of the kingdom changed drastically, with skyscrapers being built to escape the zombie horde. The laws became monarchic, with the ruler making all decisions to protect their people. Agnosticism became the dominant religion, as people struggled to understand why the zombie outbreak had occurred. The language became vowel-heavy, as people shouted to be heard over the moans of the undead. The fashion trend shifted to beaded clothing, as it was believed to ward off the zombies. Despite all these changes, the people of Iridescent remained creative in finding ways to survive the zombie apocalypse.
