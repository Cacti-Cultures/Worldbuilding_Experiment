In the badlands of the Iron Age, there existed a squat society of Phoenixes, who were lignivorous creatures that subsisted on a diet of wood. They lived in an underwater city, built with great discipline and devotion, that was only accessible through a network of tunnels.

Despite being a plutocracy, the Phoenixes were respectful of one another and followed communal laws that ensured everyone prospered. However, their informal economy often led to indifference towards outsiders, which caused frequent conflicts and isolation.

The Phoenixes were monotheistic and their religion was centered around a hawk, which was their symbol of strength and prosperity. They spoke in a staccato language and wore symbolic fashion that represented their devotion to their culture.

The main occupation of the Phoenixes was farming, which they did with great discipline and respect for nature. They believed that their devotion to nature was what gave them their strength and prosperity.

Although they lived underwater, the Phoenixes had a deep connection with the land and the badlands, which they considered sacred. They often traveled to the surface to pay their respects to the land and to offer their thanks for the prosperity they had been given.

Despite their isolation, the Phoenixes were a thriving society, and their underwater city was a testament to their resilience and ingenuity. They were a community that valued communal laws and respected one another, which allowed them to prosper in the badlands.
