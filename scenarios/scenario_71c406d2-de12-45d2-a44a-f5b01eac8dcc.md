In the plateau of the Satyrs, a hunched and devotional society of open-minded creatures ruled under a celestocracy. Though they valued justice and spiritualism, their undisciplined nature often led to conflicts of intimidation. The Satyrs were in the Bronze Age, with blacksmiths and corporations being their primary occupations, and their diet primarily planktivorous. They had a fascination with futuristic fashion and architecture, often featuring domed buildings carved with dragon symbols. Their language was agglutinative, and their laws were fascist, with little room for dissent. However, despite their flaws, the Satyrs were known for their open-mindedness and willingness to learn new things. When their land was invaded, they used their knowledge of bronze technology and justice to fend off their enemies, ultimately emerging victorious.
