In the metallic society of the Manticores, bureaucracy is the norm. Creativity is encouraged, but only within the confines of the fascist laws that govern their underwater city in the tundra. Theism is the dominant religion, and seers are highly respected for their ability to predict the fearful events that occur in their planktivorous diet sustaining ecosystem. The Manticores are a fearless species, but their untrustworthy nature leads to conflict avoidance rather than direct confrontation. The Renaissance technology they possess is used primarily for bartering with neighboring societies during droughts. The willow is a symbol of hope and resilience that is often used in their functional fashion. The click language they speak is unique to their society and is used in all official conversations. Despite their many challenges, the Manticores remain a proud and thriving civilization.
