In the vast and arid dunes, there lived a society of gargoyles. They were a fluffy and sincere community, but their society was unstable due to their ergatocracy system. Each member of the community had a voice, but the lack of a true leader led to frequent uprisings. Despite this, the gargoyles valued their independence and respected nature. They were omnivorous, but practiced asceticism in their religious beliefs. Their economy operated on a mercantilism system, and they were in the Bronze Age technologically. The gargoyles were hunters and had a deep respect for the bear, which was a symbol of strength and resilience in their culture. Their architecture was burrow-like, and they spoke in a tonal language. Their fashion was naturalistic, consisting of clothing made from animal hides. However, their laws were monarchic, and they struggled with finding a way to reconcile their desire for independence with the need for a strong leader. Despite their challenges, the gargoyles remained a tight-knit community, driven by their sincere desire to find stability and peace within their society.
