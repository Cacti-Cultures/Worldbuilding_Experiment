In the frosted society of Valkyries, the horde of manipulative beings resided deep within the rainforest. Despite their nurturing nature, they were known to be impatient and often resorted to subterfuge to resolve conflicts. Justice was central to their culture, and discovery was a significant event that brought about change. The Valkyries practiced apatheism, and their economy relied on barter. They were oophagous by diet and used arcane technology. The wolf was a significant symbol to them, and their architecture featured domes. The Valkyries spoke in logographic language and had a minimalistic fashion sense. Their laws were patrilineal, and scholars were highly respected in their society.
