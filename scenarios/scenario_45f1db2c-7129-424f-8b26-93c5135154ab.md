In a dystopian world where society has taken to the skies, the Yuki-onna, a folivorous people, live in a terraced city overlooking the vast savannah below. Despite their innovative culture and primordial technology, the Yuki-onna have fallen under the rule of a fascist corporatist government that values utilitarianism over individuality. The society has become apathetic, with many feeling hopeless about their future. However, a hopeful few have begun to speak out and plan an exodus from their aerial city in search of a better life. The Yuki-onna's religion of apatheism has led to a lack of conflict resolution skills, but a group of mediators, including a skilled blacksmith, have stepped forward to help facilitate the journey. The Yuki-onna wear uniform clothing adorned with symbols of stars and speak in a sibilant language. Despite the egalitarian laws in place, the society remains divided between the apathetic and the hopeful.
