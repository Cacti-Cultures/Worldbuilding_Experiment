In the frosted highlands, there lived a society of hydras who were known for their creativity and harmonious relationship with nature. Despite being oophagous, they practiced conservation and mutualism, trading with neighboring societies and living in an underwater city that blended seamlessly with the environment. Their language was harmonic, and their fashion was primal, with symbols of bears often adorning their clothing. The society's architecture was industrial, with a touch of particracy, but they maintained a deep respect for the natural world. However, their impatience sometimes caused conflict with other societies, and the recent flood had tested their resolve. The society's religion was apatheism, and their laws were anarchic, valuing absolution over punishment. Despite the challenges, the hydras remained resilient, adapting to their changing environment, and finding ways to live in harmony with the world around them.
