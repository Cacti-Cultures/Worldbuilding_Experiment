Deep in the peaks of a barren mountain range, there lies a stoic society of bald creatures called the Tsukumogami. They have a unique culture that values chivalry and upholding the laws of their Restorative justice system. However, their society is plagued by a severe drought, which has caused their carnivorous diets to become scarce. The Tsukumogami have turned to their polytheistic religion for guidance, but some have become self-centered in their desperation for survival. Despite the turmoil, the Tsukumogami remain subservient to the natural world, as they rely on the wind to bring rain and sustain their arcane technology. The warriors of their society, who reside in treehouses, are tasked with finding a solution to their struggles. They must work together to find absolution for their society and use their consonant-rich language to communicate their plans. The Tsukumogami's fashion is adorned with intricate beaded designs and their architecture is built into the trees. Despite their Noocracy government, the society leans towards socialism as they believe in providing for one another in times of need.
