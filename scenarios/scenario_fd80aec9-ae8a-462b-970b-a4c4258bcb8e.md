In the vast steppes of the Asuras, a hunched society of folivorous beings lived in hillside dwellings. The Asuras were an ergatocracy, where the tanners held the most power. They spoke in a click language and practiced animism, where they believed in the harmony of nature. The Asuras were composed and avoided conflict at all costs, as their laws were oligarchic. They lived in a medieval society with a primal fashion and used informal economies to trade goods. Despite living in a dark age, the Asuras believed in conservation and had a deep respect for the land they lived on. Their economy relied heavily on tanning and the use of the rose symbol. Although joyless, the Asuras found solace in their harmonious way of life.
