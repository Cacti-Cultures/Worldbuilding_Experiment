In the bayou of a lush and harmonious land, the robust society of herbivorous mummies thrived under a kraterocracy, where the strongest and most precise warriors held power. Despite their hostile nature, the mummies valued hospitality and had a culture that revolved around it. Their polytheistic religion was infused in every aspect of their lives, from their egalitarian laws to their layered fashion. The mummies' economy was largely informal, and they had a renaissance-like approach to technology. However, their conflict resolution was passive, and they used symbols like the bear to communicate. Their architecture was characterized by imposing forts, and their language was peculiarly verb-less. But their most defining event was the revolution that resulted in a more just and fair society.
