In the feudal society of Matte, the griffins were revered for their chivalrous behavior and noble character, but some members of the species were seen as ignoble due to their sanguivorous diets. Innovation was highly valued in this society, and the griffins played a key role in the enlightenment events that took place in the coral reefs. The griffins followed a monotheistic religion and practiced communalism in their economics, with potters being one of the main occupations. The griffin symbol was the raven and their architecture was characterized by cliffside dwellings. The language of the griffins was unique, as it lacked verbs, and fashion was highly status-oriented. However, the laws of Matte were fascist, and conflict was often resolved through appeasement rather than justice. Despite this, the nurturing nature of the griffins and their medieval technology made them a vital part of the society.
