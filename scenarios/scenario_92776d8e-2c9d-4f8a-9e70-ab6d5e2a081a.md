In a far-off plateau, deep in the heart of an ancient society of lithe yokai, a courageous guild of scholars labored away at their work, surrounded by the dominant and awe-inspiring nature of the land. The society was kinship-based, with a strong sense of community and a paganistic reverence for the mountainous landscape. Despite this, the society was struggling with an uprising among the joyless members, who felt isolated and disconnected from the rest of their society. The guild, however, remained resilient, and their naturalistic fashion and guttural language only served to highlight their commitment to their craft. The society's laws were socialist, but capitalism was slowly creeping in as trade became more common in the iron age. The guild's work was largely focused on the study of coprophagous diets of the local fauna, and their findings were highly regarded by the community. Their igloo-like architecture blended seamlessly with the natural surroundings, and their use of iron-age technology allowed them to delve deeper into their research. Despite the challenges they faced, the guild remained stalwart in their pursuit of knowledge, and their unwavering determination served as a symbol of hope in troubled times.
