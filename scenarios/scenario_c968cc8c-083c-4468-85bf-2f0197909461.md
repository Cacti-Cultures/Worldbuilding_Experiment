In the glittering society of the Griffins, the logocracy ruled with an iron fist. Despite the dishonorable tactics used by those in power, the people remained resourceful and independent. The prosperity of the Rift Valley was the result of their folivorous diets and conservationist beliefs. The ancestor-worship religion was prevalent, and the hawk was a symbol of strength and freedom. The Griffins lived in stilt houses and were skilled gatherers, utilizing stone age technology. The language spoken was isolating, but the people made up for it with their functional fashion sense. Despite the totalitarian laws, the society managed to maintain a level of compromise to avoid conflict. The plutocracy was evident, but the Griffins were able to make the most of their resources and thrive in their unique culture.
