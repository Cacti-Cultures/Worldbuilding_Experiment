In the taiga, where the bitter cold wind howled and the snow lay thick on the ground, the massive dragons roamed. These nomadic creatures had a communalist society, where everyone worked together to survive in the harsh environment. They were known for their warm personalities, always willing to help those in need. However, their inflexibility could lead to conflict, especially during times of war. The dragons were stoic beings, with a deep animistic religion that revered the natural world. They lived off a carnivorous diet and had an industrial level of technology, with floating islands that served as their homes. The dragons spoke in a sibilant language, and their fashion was futuristic, designed to protect against the unforgiving cold. Despite their warm nature, the dragons' laws were fascistic, and their conflict resolution involved absolute punishment. The dragons' occupation was weaving, and their symbol was ice, which represented their ability to survive in the harshest of conditions. The indifferent nature of the taiga meant that the dragons had to be tough to survive, and they were known for their resilience and tenacity.
