In the iridescent society of the vampires, they lived in a commune on top of a plateau sustained by geothermal technology. Their honorable culture was based on ancestor-worship and mercantilism. The vampires were composed and valued compromise in their conflicts. Scholars were highly respected and occupied the crystal palace, where they studied hieroglyphic language and wrote about the sustainable insectivorous diets of their ancestors. The vampires' architecture was adorned with hawk symbols and draped fashion. Their society was patrilineal, and laws were based on the principles of honor and compromise. However, some vampires were unobservant of these principles, leading to the Reformation, where the laws were restructured.
