The archipelago of Lithe was a coexistent society, where people lived in harmony with nature and followed a folivorous diet. Farmers were highly respected for their work, and their status in society was determined by the amount of wind symbols they owned. Despite being an unambitious society, they had a strong sense of valor and forgiveness. Laws were anarchic, and conflicts were often confrontational, but they were resolved through mutualism and harmonic language. However, an uprising had recently occurred, and the ochlocracy was in chaos. Sirens blared across the islands, warning people of the danger as they took refuge in igloos. The agnosticism prevalent in the society was shaken, and people began to question their beliefs. The renaissance in technology had not yet reached Lithe, and the society struggled to find a way to restore order. It was a challenging time for the people of Lithe, but their forgiving nature and sense of valor would help them weather the storm.
