In the Horned society of the Djinns, a group of considerate and creative beings reside in a beautiful archipelago with geothermal technology and a strong belief in spiritualism. The Djinns are oophagous and their diets consist primarily of eggs. They have a protective nature and value prosperity, which is reflected in their events and architecture such as the crystal palace that stands tall in the middle of their capital city. However, due to their anxious tendencies, the Djinns often isolate themselves from outsiders and have oligarchic laws in place. This has led to conflicts with neighboring societies and a reliance on their shamans to mediate any disputes. The Djinns use hieroglyphic language and embroidered fashion to express themselves and their love for fire is represented in their symbols. Despite their noocracy, the Djinns practice syndicalism in their economy, which has led to a strong sense of community and cooperation among their people.
