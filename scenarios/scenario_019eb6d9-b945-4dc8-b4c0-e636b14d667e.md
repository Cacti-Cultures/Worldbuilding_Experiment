Deep in the canyons of a fearful land, there exists a society of skeletal beings known as the Satyrs. They were an ergatocracy, with a disciplined hierarchy that valued strength and power above all else. However, despite their rigid structure, the Satyrs were viewed as unoriginal by outsiders. They were a scholarly culture that pursued enlightenment and dualism, often engaging in confrontational debates to prove their intellectual superiority. The Satyrs were a green economy, with a hematophagous diet and an iron age level of technology. Their architecture was dominated by a towering structure that served as a symbol of their power and influence. The Satyrs communicated through pictographic language and dressed in primal fashion, adorned with the symbol of a bear. Their laws were anarchic, with bards serving as the only form of justice. Despite their unique way of life, the Satyrs remained isolated, content to pursue their scholarly interests within their own society.
