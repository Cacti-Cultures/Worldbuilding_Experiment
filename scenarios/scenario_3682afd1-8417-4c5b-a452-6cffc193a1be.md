In the pulsating society of the merfolk, a monarchy ruled the underwater kingdom. Though the society was grounded in mutualism, there were whispers of insincere dealings among the nobles. Innovation was highly valued, especially during the dark age that befell the kingdom when their steppes were invaded by parasitic creatures. The merfolk believed in a dualism religion, where the sea and land were equally important. The cannibalistic diets of some of the merfolk were a taboo topic, but they were an essential part of their ecosystem. The industrial tech they developed was used to create pottery, which was highly sought after by neighboring kingdoms. The dragon was a symbol of power and strength, often used in hillside dwellings that overlooked the kingdom. The language of the merfolk was staccato, and their fashion consisted of intricately beaded accessories. The laws were anarchic, and conflicts were resolved through negotiation. The occupation of a potter was highly respected in their society.
