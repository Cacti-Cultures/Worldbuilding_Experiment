In the heart of the Rift Valley, there lived a community of fae who were known for their serene way of life. Their society was based on a kinship culture, where everyone looked out for each other, and the glassy-eyed fae shared a strong bond. They were a noocracy, where wisdom and knowledge were highly valued, and decisions were made by the most intelligent among them. The fae were lignivorous and lived in treehouses embroidered with symbols of stars. Their language was consonant-rich, and they followed the teachings of gnosticism. They practiced socialism and believed in the redistribution of resources to ensure that everyone had enough. The fae were hunters and survived on what nature provided, for it was indifferent to their existence. However, one day, they made an important discovery that threatened their way of life. They found a primordial technology that could change everything they knew. Some fae were tempted by the power it offered and became greedy, while others wanted to appease and avoid conflict. The community was faced with a difficult decision, and the oligarchic laws they followed made it even more challenging. The fae had to find a way to balance their desire for progress with their serene way of life.
