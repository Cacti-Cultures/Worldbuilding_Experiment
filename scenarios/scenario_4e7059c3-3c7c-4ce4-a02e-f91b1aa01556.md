In the land of Lithe, sorcerers held the power in this ergatocracy, where the ruling class were those who labored the hardest. Despite the harmonious society that the sorcerers maintained, there was an underlying instability due to the fear of a power struggle amongst them. Loyalty to one's fellow sorcerers was key, as they practiced polytheism and believed in the power of the arcane. The Renaissance had brought about a resurgence of interest in their magic, and many traveled to the glaciers to hone their craft. However, anarcho-capitalism had crept into the economy, causing a divide amongst the sorcerers. Some were content with their folivorous diets, while others had become brewers and were more interested in the seasonal fashion trends that had emerged. The castle-like architecture and authoritative laws were a symbol of their power, but the comet in the night sky was a reminder of their fear of the unknown. Conflict was often passive, as sorcerers preferred to use their magic to manipulate situations rather than engage in physical confrontation. Despite the complexities of their language being polysynthetic, it was their loyalty to one another that kept this society from collapsing.
