In the archipelago of Yetis, a revolution was brewing. The society had become bloated with a strict meritocracy that favored the wealthy and powerful. Yet, despite this, the Yetis were a compassionate people, with a culture that celebrated creativity and a religion of apatheism. However, their disobedience to the autocratic laws had caused conflict and isolation from neighboring societies. The Yetis had long been herbivorous and used industrial technology to maintain a utilitarian lifestyle. The occupation of a seer was highly respected, and the serpent was a symbol of wisdom and foresight. The crystal palace was a stunning example of their unique architecture, and sign language was the primary form of communication. The Yetis had adopted a uniform fashion style, and their economy was based on syndicalism. Despite their struggles, the Yetis remained hopeful for change and a more just society that would embrace their compassionate nature and respect their creativity.
