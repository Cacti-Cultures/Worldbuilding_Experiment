In the frozen tundra of the Fanged society, a monarchy ruled with an iron fist. Their economy was based on fascist corporatism, with only the strongest and most ruthless surviving. The society was divided into two factions - the hemotaphagous warriors who fed on the blood of their enemies, and the parasitic untrustworthy individuals who would do anything for power.

The Yuki-onna, a race of beings who could control the winds, lived in yurts scattered throughout the tundra. They were content with their simple lifestyle and followed the teachings of Taoism. They believed in justice and fairness, unlike the rest of the Fanged society.

One day, a treaty was signed between the Yuki-onna and the Fanged society. The Yuki-onna agreed to help the Fanged society in their wars, using their wind powers to aid their warriors. In exchange, the Fanged society promised to protect the Yuki-onna from their enemies.

However, the Fanged society's anarchic laws made it difficult for the Yuki-onna to trust them. They feared that the Fanged society would turn on them once they were no longer needed. Despite this, the Yuki-onna remained true to their word and helped the Fanged society win many battles.

As time passed, the Yuki-onna's fashion became more muted, in contrast to the fire symbols that adorned the Fanged society's clothing. The language of the Fanged society was pictographic, with their laws relying on confrontational tactics.

Despite their differences, the Yuki-onna and the Fanged society managed to coexist, with each benefiting from the other's strengths. The Yuki-onna continued to live in their yurts, following their Taoist beliefs, while the Fanged society remained a monarchy, ruled by their powerful warriors.
