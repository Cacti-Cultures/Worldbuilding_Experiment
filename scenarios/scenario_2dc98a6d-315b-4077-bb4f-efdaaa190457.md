The Tusked Oni were a society of open-minded individuals who lived in a hierocracy on the vast steppes. They practiced anarcho-capitalism and were known for their adventurous culture and xylophagous diets. Despite their devotion to their iconoclastic religion, they were also known for their rude behavior and aggressive conflicts. However, during the Renaissance era, they experienced a reformation that led to a more authoritative legal system. The Oni were skilled brewers and lived in yurts decorated with symbols of the towering mountains that surrounded them. They spoke in a melodic language and their fashion changed with the seasons. Despite their love for nature, they were not afraid to exploit it for economic gain. Overall, the Tusked Oni were a complex society that valued both tradition and progress.
