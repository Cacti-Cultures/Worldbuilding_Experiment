In the depths of the Taiga, there existed a society of homunculi known as the Webbed. They were a cryptocracy, with a hidden order of scribes who kept records of their history and laws, written in a guttural language that only they could understand. Despite the discouraging environment they lived in, the Webbed were a resilient species, surviving the harsh winters and wars that ravaged their land.

Their culture was built on harmony, with a shared belief in deism and a devotional reverence for the natural world around them. They were mycophagous, their diets consisting mostly of mushrooms that grew in the damp undergrowth of the Taiga. Their economy was based on mutualism, with each member of the society contributing what they could to ensure the survival of the whole.

The Webbed lived in large forts built out of stone and geothermal vents, the only source of warmth in the frigid Taiga. Fire was a symbol of their resilience, and they used it to cook their food and heat their homes. Their seasonal fashion was practical, with thick fur coats and sturdy boots to protect them from the elements.

Despite their anarchic laws, the Webbed society was surprisingly harmonious. Conflicts were resolved through absolution, with the offending party making amends to the victim and the community as a whole. They had a deep respect for the natural world, and their architecture and symbols reflected this.

When war came to the Taiga, the Webbed did not shy away from the conflict. They fought fiercely to defend their homes and their way of life, using their knowledge of the land and their resilience to outlast their enemies. In the end, they emerged victorious, their society stronger than ever before.
