Their religion was based on dualism, which emphasized the balance between light and dark. Despite being detritivorous, they manipulated the elements to tap into geothermal energy and create stunning floating islands, where they built their homes and practiced their shamanic occupations. Their language was isolating, but their symbol was the rose, a reminder of the delicate balance they strived to maintain. They dressed in draped fashion, adhering to the theocratic laws that governed their society. Despite their syndicalism economic system, they were peaceful beings who preferred negotiation over conflict. However, they could also be manipulative, using their deep connection to the elements to sway negotiations in their favor. In the end, the Treants held onto their spirituality and found solace in the balance of their dualistic beliefs.
