In the archipelago of the Golems, a gracious and industrious society of protectorates flourished. The golems were known for their collective efforts towards conservationist practices and their insectivorous diets, which were sustained through their occupation as gatherers. The golems revered the sun as a symbol of their monotheistic religion, and their architecture was characterized by towering pyramids that were built using arcane technology. Their language was sibilant, and their fashion was ritualistic, with intricate designs that represented their restorative laws. Despite their bloated appearance, the golems were swift in their migration, often avoiding conflict with outsiders through their uncreative approach to diplomacy. They believed in the power of collectivism and viewed themselves as a society that thrived on the principles of protection and gratitude towards nature.
