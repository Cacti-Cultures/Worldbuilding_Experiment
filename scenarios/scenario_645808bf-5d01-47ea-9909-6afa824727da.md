In the steppes of the cyberocracy, the industrious vampires lived in burrows deep beneath the earth. Their society was based on fascist corporatism, with a theocratic legal system in place to maintain order. The vampires were frugivorous and their diet consisted of fruits that they grew in their underground farms. They were an exploitative species, and always looked for ways to gain an advantage over others. However, they were also zealous in their devotion to their religion, which was based on deism. The seers among them communicated through a whistled language, and their fashion was always vibrant and eye-catching. The vampires were known for their confrontational nature, and would often settle disputes with other underground species through fights. Despite this, they were also considered cowardly, as they would often back down from fights they knew they couldn't win. The flood that came through the steppes was a challenging time for the vampires, but they were able to survive thanks to their expertise in stone age technology. The bear was a symbol of power and strength among them, and they would often decorate their burrows with bear pelts. Overall, the vampires were a hairy, but resilient species that relied on their creativity and innovation to survive in their harsh underground world.
