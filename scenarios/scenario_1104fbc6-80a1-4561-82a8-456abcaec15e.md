The glowing society of Dryads in the Rift Valley lived under a diarchy, with two leaders who maintained a harmonious relationship despite their indecisive tendencies. Their culture valued loyalty, and they were known for their conservationist practices and nectarivorous diets. Their technology was limited to the Stone Age, and their language was communicated through hieroglyphics. The Dryads' fashion was ornate, with intricate patterns and designs adorning their clothing. Their laws were anarchic, allowing for a great deal of freedom in their society. However, conflicts sometimes arose, and intimidation tactics were used by some to gain power. Scholars were highly respected in this society, and the raven was seen as a symbol of wisdom. The landscape was threatened by a recent flood, but the Dryads were steadfast in their commitment to preserving nature. Despite their fascist corporatism approach to economics, the castle-like architecture of their cities was a testament to their advanced building skills. Dualism was an important aspect of their religion, and they believed in the balance between good and evil.
