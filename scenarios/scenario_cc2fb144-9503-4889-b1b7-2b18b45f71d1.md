In the multicolored society of the ghouls, democracy was the norm, but it often resulted in passive leadership. Despite this, the ghouls were chivalrous and prided themselves on their scholarly culture, where healers were highly respected. However, when a flood hit their village, the ghouls were subservient to the power of nature and struggled to survive amidst the glaciers. They turned to shamanism for guidance, seeking absolution for their sins. Meanwhile, their mercantilist economy was in shambles, and scavenging became the only way to survive. The ghouls had once been industrial but were forced to return to a more primitive way of life, building stilt houses to escape the rising waters. As they worked to rebuild their village, they found solace in the harmonic language they spoke and the embroidered fashion they wore. However, fascist laws were enforced to maintain order and prevent chaos from erupting. Despite their struggles, the ghouls continued to look to the moon as a symbol of hope, a constant reminder of the light at the end of the tunnel.
