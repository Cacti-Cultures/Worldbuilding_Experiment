In the caverns of the Aos Si, an ancient ghostly society, the hierocracy of the monarchic laws is upheld by the considerate builders who construct the ornate cliffside dwellings. The Aos Si people practice a conservationist culture, deeply rooted in spiritualism, and they revere the mountain as a symbol of their beliefs. Their language is harmonic and their religion is entwined with nature, which is parasitic and prone to conflict. A plague has spread through the Aos Si community, and their informal economy has collapsed, forcing some to turn to cannibalistic diets in order to survive. This has caused tension within the society, with some becoming vengeful towards those who have resorted to eating their own kind. Despite this, the Aos Si people have adapted to their harsh environment, using iron age technology to defend themselves against threats. The society is deeply divided, with some members seeking to maintain the old ways and others pushing for change.
