In the shelled society of Lamia, the physical environment is ruled by an envirotocracy that values the nurturing of the wetlands above all else. Their culture is centered around kinship, with families living together in vibrant, layered homes. However, their economy is controlled by a plutocracy that has built towering skyscrapers for their own benefit. The Lamia people are lignivorous and practice ancestor-worship as their religion. They have a timid nature and conflict is often resolved through intimidation. The occupation of bard is highly respected, as they are the ones who tell the stories of their ancestors. The comet is a symbol of good fortune and is often used in their artwork. The language of Lamia is verb-less, making communication a challenge for outsiders. The laws are theocratic, with religious leaders playing a significant role in governance. Despite their differences, the Lamia people come together during times of war to protect their beloved wetlands.
