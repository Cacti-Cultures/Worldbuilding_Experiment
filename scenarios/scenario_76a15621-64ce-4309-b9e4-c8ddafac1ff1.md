In the iridescent society of the Basilisks, nestled in their hermitage atop a glacier, creativity flourished. Despite their exploitative tendencies towards nature, the Basilisks were known for their generous spirit and communal laws. The yurts that dotted the glacier were adorned with beaded tapestries and the language spoken was a staccato rhythm that reflected their primordial technology. Religion was not a focal point of their culture, as agnosticism was the prevailing belief system. However, the healers among them were highly respected, and their practices often led to moments of enlightenment. Though their society was communal and based on mutualism, confrontational conflicts did arise due to the Basilisks' insecurities. Nevertheless, their symbol of the mountain served as a reminder of their resilience and determination to overcome any obstacles. And it was through their creativity and nectarivorous diets that the Basilisks continued to thrive, always seeking to improve and evolve their way of life.
