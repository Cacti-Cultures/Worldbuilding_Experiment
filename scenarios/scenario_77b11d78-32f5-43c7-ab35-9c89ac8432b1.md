In the archipelago of the tentacled society, a Yuki-onna shaman led a revolution against the autocratic laws that had long governed their underwater city. The society's hierarchy had always been based on physical strength, but the Yuki-onna challenged this by using her humorous wit to rally the planktivorous citizens to demand independence and respect for nature. The Yuki-onna's confrontational approach clashed with the hateful attitudes of the ruling class who prized capitalism above all else. However, the Yuki-onna's respect for the environment and use of geothermal technology allowed her to gain the support of the people. As the revolution progressed, the Yuki-onna's staccato language and draped fashion became symbols of the movement. The Yuki-onna's asceticism and bear symbolism also drew followers who were disillusioned with the materialistic society. In the end, the Yuki-onna succeeded in establishing a new society where everyone was valued and respected, and where the laws were based on fairness and equality.
