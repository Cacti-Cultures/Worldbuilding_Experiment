The mandrakes were a society that lived in the heptarchy of canyons, where the landscape was as vibrant as their culture. They were known for their folivorous diets, and their shaman were dependable healers who used theism and subterfuge to cure their people. The mandrakes were fiercely independent and had a matrilineal law system. They had a love for decorative fashion, ornate architecture, and an underwater city was their greatest masterpiece during their renaissance era. Despite their ignorance of the outside world, the mandrakes were a communalist society that valued their independence above everything else. Their language was guttural and their most important symbol was fire, which they believed brought them the power to fight against any revolution that threatened their way of life. However, their society was also unstable, and the mandrakes were always on the brink of conflict due to their love of subterfuge. Despite all this, the mandrakes remained a dependable society, and their shaman continued to heal their people with their knowledge of the natural world.
