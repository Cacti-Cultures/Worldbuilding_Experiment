The Titans were a society of muscular beings who lived in a physical world governed by a netocracy. Their positive energy was contagious, but unfortunately, their dishonest nature often led to disputes and conflict. Despite this, their culture was deeply rooted in kinship, and they came together during natural disasters like the flood that devastated the bayou where they lived. Their religion was based on totemism, which revered the natural world, and their economics were based on collectivism, where everyone contributed to the greater good. Their diets were mainly scavenger-based, and their technology was still in its primordial stage. Nature was devotional to them, and they often turned to it for guidance in times of need. Judicial conflict resolution was common, and their weavers were highly respected for their skills in creating intricate designs that often featured the symbol of the dragon. Their architecture was dominated by domes, and their language was mostly whistled, which allowed them to communicate over long distances. They adorned themselves with feathered fashion, and their laws were retributive, meaning that punishment was swift and often severe.
