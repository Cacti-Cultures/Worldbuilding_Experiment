The Griffins were a society of spiky creatures that lived in a caste system on the coral reefs. They were known for their spontaneous acts of loyalty, but also for their vengeful nature. Their culture was centered around the idea of dualism, with a belief in both good and evil. Despite their carnivorous diets, they practiced a green economy and lived in a stone age society with manipulative tendencies. Conflict resolution often involved compromise and their brewers were highly respected members of society. The serpent was a symbol of power and wisdom, and their crystal palace architecture was breathtaking. The Griffins spoke in a rhythmic language and their fashion was ritualistic, with clothing being an important part of their identity. Their laws were socialist in nature, with a focus on the greater good rather than individual gain. It was during a period of enlightenment that the Griffins learned to embrace their differences and work together towards a brighter future.
