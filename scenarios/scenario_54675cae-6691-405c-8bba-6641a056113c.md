In the ancient land of Ashen, the Nagas, a herbivorous species, lived in the peaks where the air was thin and the land was sustainable. The Nagas had a unique society that was based on loyalty, and their economy was based on the barter system. They had a technocracy that was primordial and a religion that was based on pantheism, with the dragon being their symbol. The Nagas were known for their perseverance, but their society was also unstable due to the use of coercion in resolving conflicts. The Golden Age of the Nagas was marked by communal laws and a consonant-rich language that was used by bards to tell stories and sing songs. Their architecture was in the form of a pyramid, and they wore feathered clothing. Despite their unstable society, the Nagas managed to maintain their culture through the use of sustainable practices.
