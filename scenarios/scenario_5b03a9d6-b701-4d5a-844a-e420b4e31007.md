In the glittering society of the Phoenixes, tradition and mysticism were integral parts of their culture. The phylarchy was conscientious in maintaining harmony with nature, and their granivorous diets were sustained by the fertile Rift Valley. Despite their mercantilist approach to economics, the Phoenixes remained grounded in primordial technology and a rhythmically spoken language. Their architecture was unique, with treehouses as the main form of shelter, while their fashion was layered with intricate patterns and symbols of wind. Laws were monarchic, with a blacksmith class catering to the needs of the ruling class. However, conflict arose when selfish tendencies threatened to disrupt the society's harmonious existence. The migration created a rift in the community, leading to the need for absolution. Despite this, the Phoenixes remained dedicated to their traditions and continued to uphold their society's values.
