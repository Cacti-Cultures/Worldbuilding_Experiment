In the canyon city of the Radiant Nymphs, the netocracy reigned supreme. The determined ruling class believed in anarcho-capitalism, where the free market was the key to economic success. Despite their rigid beliefs, the society maintained harmony with animism as their religion, respecting the power of nature and its many spirits. The Nymphs were granivorous and relied on wind-powered technology, but their seers could harness the power of fire with their sibilant language. Their mountain homes were functional yet beautiful, with constitutional laws to maintain order. However, the discovery of a new technology threatened their isolationist ways, causing conflict within the society. Despite this, the Nymphs remained respectful of nature and their traditions, determined to find a way to adapt without sacrificing their culture.
