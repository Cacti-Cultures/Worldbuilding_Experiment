Deep in the heart of the icy rainforest, a society of banshees lives under the rule of a despotic monarch. Despite their patient nature, life in this traditional community has grown dull and oppressive. The banshees have long followed a polytheistic religion, but whispers of reformation are beginning to circulate among the nectarivorous population. The informal economy thrives, as banshee blacksmiths craft weapons and tools in their burrow-like dwellings. The oak tree holds great symbolic importance to the banshees, who use its leaves and bark in their feathered fashion. The language of the banshees is isolating, making communication difficult with outsiders, and their architecture is built into the forest floor, creating a maze-like network of tunnels. In this manipulative society, conflict is often resolved through absolution and forgiveness, but those who speak out against the monarch risk being cast out into the unforgiving rainforest. As the banshees enter a period of renaissance, it remains to be seen what changes will come to their isolated world.
