In the society of winged trolls, the physical structure is one of a strict patriarchy, with males holding all positions of power. Despite this, the trolls are optimistic about their future and strive for harmony amongst their community. Their diet is planktivorous, as they reside near the beautiful coral reefs. The trolls practice agnosticism and have adopted a distributist economic system, leading to great prosperity within their society. However, they face the destructive forces of nature and must constantly adapt to survive. The trolls' main occupation is trading, and their symbol is that of a mountain, representing their strength and resilience. Their architecture is terraced, with intricately embroidered clothing being a popular fashion choice. They have a constitutional law system and use a logographic language for communication. Despite their positivity, the trolls are often criticized for their unoriginality, but they embrace their Renaissance-era technology and continue to innovate in all aspects of their culture.
