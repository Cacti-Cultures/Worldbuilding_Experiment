The tailed changelings lived in a stratocracy that prized prudence above all else, but their society was marred by a reputation for dishonorable tactics in times of war. They had a culture of hospitality, welcoming travelers to their stilt houses in the dunes and offering insectivorous dishes as a sign of respect. Animism was their religion, and they believed every creature had a spirit. Despite having a market socialist economy, they placed more value on communal living than individual wealth. The changelings were in the midst of a renaissance, with potters showcasing their intricate designs and decorative fashion becoming more popular. The wolf symbol was highly regarded and often used in their polysynthetic language. Egalitarian laws were followed, but there was a confrontational attitude towards those who challenged their way of life. However, their ignorance of the outside world often led to misunderstandings.
