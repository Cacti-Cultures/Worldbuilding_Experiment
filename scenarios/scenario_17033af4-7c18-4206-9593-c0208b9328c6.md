In the frozen tundra of the world, a society of brawny djinns lived in a heterarchy where physical strength determined social status. Despite their intimidating nature, the djinns were nurturing and believed in the Taoist principle of living in harmony with nature. Their economy thrived on a gift economy where the exchange of goods and services was based on trust and mutual aid.

The djinns were oophagous, their diet consisting mostly of eggs from the parasitic creatures that lived in the tundra. They were known for their innovation and had a renaissance of technology, with scholars working on creating new tools and machines to aid their community. They had even built an underwater city with unique architecture, where they could study the aquatic life and learn from them.

In this society, the serpent was a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, and the scholars were highly respected for their contributions to the community. However, there were also those who were insincere and used their physical strength to intimidate others. The djinns had experienced a revolution in the past, where they overthrew their oppressive leaders and established a socialist system of laws.

The language of the djinns was a click language, and their fashion was primal, with animal hides and furs being the norm. Despite their differences, the djinns lived in harmony with one another, and their nurturing nature made them a close-knit community.
