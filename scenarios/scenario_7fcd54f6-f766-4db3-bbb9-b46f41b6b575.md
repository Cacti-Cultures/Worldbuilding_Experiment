In a world of towering Giants, the society of the Shelled was led by a Prudent Exilarchy, who governed with an authoritative hand. Their culture was steeped in tradition, with a monotheistic religion and cannibalistic diets. They lived amongst the coral reefs, in grand Mountainhomes built with industrial technology. However, despite their prowess, they were a fearful people, always on the brink of conflict. When faced with a threat, they often chose careless capitulation, leading to a corporatist economy that favored the powerful. Despite this, their language was vowel-heavy and their fashion functional, with willow symbols adorning their clothing. And yet, despite their many flaws, the Shelled were a people with a strong sense of history, preserved by their bards who sang tales of their migration and the trials they faced.
