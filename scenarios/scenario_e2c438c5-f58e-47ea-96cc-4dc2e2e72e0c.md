In the badlands of the Quilled society, the nymphs thrived in their artistic culture. Despite living under a kakistocracy, their creativity flourished, and they celebrated the prosperity that came with their frugivorous diets. However, the society was plagued by a parasitic nature that left many feeling anxious and confrontational. The nymphs found solace in their spiritualism, and their language was vowel-heavy, allowing their words to roll off their tongues like a serpent. They lived in burrows, with minimalist fashion and iron age technology. Despite their talents as artisans, their society was syndicalist, and they struggled with constitutional laws. Nonetheless, they found beauty in their vowel-heavy language, and their architecture reflected their burrowing nature. Despite their challenges, the nymphs continued to create, with their art serving as a symbol of hope in an anxious world.
