In the wetlands of a distant, barbed society, a plague ravages the frugivorous Yetis, forcing them to turn to their ancient pagan religion for answers. Despite their forgiving nature, the Yetis become increasingly aggressive as they struggle to survive, resorting to dishonorable tactics to protect their allodialism, or land ownership. The scribes of their culture record the chaos, using a pictographic language to preserve their culture's values of valor and hawk symbolism. In a twist of fate, the parasitic Renaissance technology of the outsiders who brought the plague inadvertently leads to a restorative capitalism that helps the Yetis recover. They build treehouses as a symbolic reminder of their resilience and incorporate the outsiders' advancements while maintaining their unique culture. Through forgiveness and innovation, the Yetis emerge from the plague stronger than ever before.
