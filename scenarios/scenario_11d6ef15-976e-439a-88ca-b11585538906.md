Deep in the highlands of the Ashen society, there lies a small hermitage inhabited by a group of gnomes who have managed to maintain a balanced lifestyle despite their inconsistent nature. These gnomes have deep roots in conservation and nature nurturing, and are known to have played a significant role during the Golden Age of their civilization. Their religious beliefs are centered around theism, and they have an informal economy that relies heavily on their carnivorous diets. Technologically, they are in the Bronze Age, but their knowledge of the natural world is unparalleled. They believe in absolution when it comes to conflicts and have a deep appreciation for bards who play a pivotal role in their society. The phoenix is a symbol of rebirth and is revered in their culture. The fort-like architecture of their hermitage is made up of layered structures that are built to blend in with the natural surroundings. They communicate using logographic language and have libertarian laws that allow them to live in harmony with the environment. Despite their small size, these gnomes have managed to create a sustainable and balanced society that is deeply rooted in nature.
