Deep in the heart of the Rift Valley lies a vibrant society ruled by a powerful monarchy. The kingdom is known for its inspiring culture of adventure, with many scholars dedicating their lives to the study and exploration of the surrounding wilderness. Despite their egalitarian laws, the society can be reactive and combative, especially when it comes to defending their land in times of war. The Barghest, a fierce and lignivorous wolf-like creature, is both a symbol of their strength and a reminder of the dangers that lurk in the wild. The people are deeply religious, practicing asceticism and valuing sustainable living. Their architecture is dominated by domes, and their language is logographic, with symbols representing both words and concepts. While they have embraced some industrial technologies, they remain committed to communalism and the principles of a sustainable economy. Their fashion is primal, with clothing made from natural materials and adorned with symbols of the wolf. Despite the challenges they face, the people of this kingdom are united in their love of adventure and their commitment to living in harmony with the natural world.
