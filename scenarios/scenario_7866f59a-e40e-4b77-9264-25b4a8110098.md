In the icy land of the Aristocracy, the people were both capable and inflexible. Their artistic culture was inspired by the beauty of the glaciers, and their religion was based on Druidism. The economy operated on participatory economics, and the people survived on a detritivorous diet. The technology was at the Bronze Age level, and the society lived in harmony with nature. However, the people faced a major conflict - adaptation to the plague that swept through their land. Builders were essential to constructing new dwellings for the sick, but the inflexible laws of the monarchic society made it difficult to respond quickly. The willow tree was a symbol of hope, and the people lived in cliffside dwellings, using an agglutinative language to communicate. Fashion was highly symbolic, with certain colors and styles representing status. Despite the challenges, the people of the Aristocracy continued to persevere, relying on their capabilities and harmonious relationship with nature.
