In the sprawling underwater city of the Fae, life was divided by clan, with each group of brawny creatures fiercely protective of their own. Despite the discordant relationships between the clans, it was considered gracious to show respect and deference to those of higher status. The Fae were a scholarly people, with a polytheistic religion and a feudal economic system. Their diets were hematophagous, and their technology was medieval at best. The indifferent nature of the surrounding steppes made conflict avoidance a key aspect of daily life. The Fae had a complex system of artisan occupations, and their symbols were often represented by ravens. Laws were autocratic and enforced through fear, and their language was sibilant. Fashion was status-oriented, with ornate and intricate designs reserved for the highest-ranking members of society. Despite the constant threat of war, the Fae continued to thrive in their underwater city, relying on their strong sense of clan loyalty to survive.
