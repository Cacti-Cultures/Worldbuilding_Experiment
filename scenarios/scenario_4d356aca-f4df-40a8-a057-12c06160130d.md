In the land of the Norns, life was both anarchic and harmonious. The people lived in yurts scattered across the dunes, each adorned with minimalistic symbols of storms that swept through the region. Despite their self-centered tendencies, the Norns were a humorous bunch, and their artistic culture flourished during the Dark Age. They practiced detritivorous diets, and their ceramic pottery was highly sought after throughout the region, making them a prosperous feudal society. Though apatheism was the norm, the Norns had a deep respect for nature and the communal laws that governed their interactions with one another. Their language was vowel-heavy and their technology was in the Bronze Age. Judicial conflicts were rare, but when they arose, they were resolved through humor and wit rather than violence. All in all, the Norns lived in a polished society that celebrated both their individualism and their communal spirit.
