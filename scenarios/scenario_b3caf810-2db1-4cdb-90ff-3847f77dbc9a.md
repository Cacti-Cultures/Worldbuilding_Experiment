In the wetlands of the feathered society, the egalitarianism of the wights was a cornerstone of their harmonious culture. They were conscientious of their environment and lived off a planktivorous diet, but their immodest nature led to a parasitic relationship with the surrounding ecosystem. The shaman played an important role in the society, using bronze age technology to heal and communicate with the guttural language of the wights. The pyramid architecture served as a symbol of their unity and was adorned with fiery symbols, a representation of their iconoclastic beliefs. A revolution was sparked by the anarcho-capitalist movement, which aimed to dismantle the libertarian laws that had been put in place by the previous regime, and the resulting conflict was settled through appeasement. Despite the challenges they faced, the feathered society continued to thrive, and their unique way of life remained a source of fascination for outsiders.
