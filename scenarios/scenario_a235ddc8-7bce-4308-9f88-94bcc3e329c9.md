In the glittering society of the Heptarchy, the Kelpies were a proud and capable people known for their creativity and green economy. Their herbivorous diet kept them healthy and strong, and their skill as artisans was revered throughout the tundra. However, their ancestor-worship religion often led to agitated conflicts with neighboring tribes, and the destructive nature of their bronze age technology only added fuel to the fire. The Kelpies were ruled by an autocratic government that enforced strict laws, but they were willing to negotiate and sign treaties when it served their interests. The dome-shaped architecture of their cities was adorned with intricate beadwork and symbols of the Raven, a creature they believed to be a powerful omen. Their staccato language was a challenge for outsiders to understand, but it only added to the mystique of the Kelpies. Despite their aggressive tendencies, they were respected for their capabilities and contributions to the heptarchy.
