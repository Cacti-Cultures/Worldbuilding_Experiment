In the shimmering society of the Nephilim, the noocracy was ruled by a theocratic system, guided by the druidic religion and a strict set of laws. The economy was dominated by fascist corporatism, which limited the opportunities for the common people. The Nephilim were known for their kind nature and conservationist culture, with a diet that consisted mostly of insects. Despite their medieval technology, they had ornate fashion and skyscraper-like architecture that reached the peaks of the mountains. The language was pictographic, and symbols of the river were revered as sacred. The shaman were respected and held important occupations in society. However, the predictable nature of the society led to a revolution, with some groups demanding a more progressive and equitable system. Intimidation tactics were used to quell the revolt, but ultimately the society had to re-evaluate their beliefs and systems.
