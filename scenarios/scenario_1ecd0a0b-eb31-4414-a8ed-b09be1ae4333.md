In the glistening society of Pegasus, a stratocracy ruled with a cold iron fist, their chivalrous attitude only extending to those within their immediate ranks. The stoic culture of the people led to a lack of expression and emotion, even during the violent uprising that rocked the Rift Valley. Shamanism was the predominant religion, with its practitioners relying on arcane technologies to coexist with the natural world. Despite their isolationist tendencies, the hunters of Pegasus practiced a communal way of life, with laws that favored the collective good over individual gain. The lignivorous diet of the people was sustained by the towering treehouses that dotted the landscape, their architecture practical and symbolic of their coexistence with nature. The consonant-rich language was spoken sparingly, with seasonal fashion and the symbol of the rose being the primary forms of expression for the people of Pegasus.
