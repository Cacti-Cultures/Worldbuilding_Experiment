In the fae society of the highlands, loyalty to the monarchy was everything. The architecture was unique, with most homes being treehouses, and the fashion was layered and colorful. The fae were herbivorous and conservationist, with laws being oligarchic and often confrontational. Despite this, the society was nurturing, and the artisans were highly respected. The language was consonant-rich, and the symbols of the storm were often used in art and architecture. However, the society was also unstable, with corporatism being prevalent and iconoclasm being a common religious belief. One day, a discovery was made that would change everything. The arcane technology that had been hidden away for centuries was finally uncovered, and the fae were split on how to use it. Some wished to use it for the betterment of the society, while others wanted to use it for more nefarious purposes. The events that followed were tumultuous, and the future of the fae society was uncertain.
