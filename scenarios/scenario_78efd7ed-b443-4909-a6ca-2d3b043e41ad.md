In the shadowy society of the marshlands, the industrious Krakens had established a corporatism bureaucracy that was both tactful and rejecting. They lived in dome-shaped structures made of iron and spoke an agglutinative language that was only understood by other Krakens. The Krakens were skilled warriors who scavenged for their food, subsisting on a diet of whatever they could find. Their religion was druidism, and they revered the hawk as a symbol of power and strength. However, the Krakens were not without conflict, and they often resorted to intimidation to get what they wanted. Despite this, their society was nurturing and they had a constitutional law system in place. But the Krakens were not content with the status quo, and a revolution was brewing. Many Krakens wanted to overthrow the current system and establish a new order that was more just and equitable. It was a tense time for the Krakens, but they knew they had to be tactful in their approach if they were to succeed.
