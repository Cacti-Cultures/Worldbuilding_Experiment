In the bloated society of vampires that lived in the marshlands, autonomism was a highly prized trait, and dependability was necessary for survival. However, there were always those who were untrustworthy, causing invasion and conflict among the stoic vampire culture. The druidic religion emphasized nurturing nature, and the herbivorous diets reflected this belief. The economy was based on participatory economics, with wind technology being the primary source of power. Scholars were highly respected and sought after, living in cave dwellings that were adorned with ritualistic symbols, such as the mountain, representing strength and stability. The language spoken by the vampires was tonal, making it difficult for outsiders to learn. The laws were theocratic, with reconciliation being the primary goal in any conflict.
