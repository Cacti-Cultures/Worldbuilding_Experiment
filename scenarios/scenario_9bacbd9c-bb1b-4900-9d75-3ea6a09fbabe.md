In the Rift Valley, there existed a society of djinn who lived on floating islands powered by geothermal energy. They were a granivorous society who primarily survived on the grains and other crops they were able to cultivate on their floating islands. Despite their harmonious relationship with nature, the society was divided by a conflict between the combative and self-centered faction and the prudent and liberty-loving faction. The society was governed by an ergatocracy, where the most hard-working and productive members held the most power. The djinn also had a unique language that was polysynthetic in nature. They had a uniform fashion and their buildings were constructed on floating islands with intricate architecture. The society valued the stars as a symbol of hope and guidance in their migration journeys. The djinn were deists who believed in a higher power, but did not follow any organized religion. The society followed syndicalism and the fishing industry was one of the most prominent occupations. The society was patrilineal, where inheritance was passed down through the male line. Despite their differences, the society was able to maintain a certain level of liberty and freedom that was unique to their culture.
