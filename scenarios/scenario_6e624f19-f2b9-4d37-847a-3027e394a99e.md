In the land of Paws, a vibrant society of sorcerers thrived under the vexiarchy, which was often viewed as an inefficient form of government. Despite this, the sorcerers continued to embark on adventures and seek enlightenment, with their journeys often taking them deep into the grotto, where they communed with the harmonious nature around them. The sorcerers were followers of Deism, and their capitalism-based economy relied heavily on geothermal technology. Their diets were lignivorous, with many of them being skilled shaman who could communicate with the plants and trees. The phoenix was a powerful symbol in their culture and was often incorporated into their ritualistic fashion. The fort-like architecture of their cities reflected their confrontational nature, and their inflected language was egalitarian in nature. Despite their differences, the sorcerers of Paws were united in their pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment.
