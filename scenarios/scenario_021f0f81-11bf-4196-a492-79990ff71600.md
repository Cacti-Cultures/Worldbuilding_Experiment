In the tusked society of the steppes, the elementals were revered and feared. They were believed to be powerful beings that controlled the elements and could awaken at any moment. The bureaucracy of the society was complex and highly structured, with each member assigned a specific role based on their occupation. The elementals were passionate creatures that were highly respected, but their sudden awakening could also make the people anxious. The society was deeply rooted in tradition and followed asceticism as a way of life. The economy was based on a gift system, and the people were mycophagous, relying on mushrooms as their primary food source. Despite being in the medieval era, the architecture of the society was unique, with floating islands being the primary form of housing. The language spoken was rhythmic, and the fashion was beaded with the sun being a significant symbol. The laws were highly authoritative, and subterfuge was the primary means of conflict resolution. The occupation of brewing was highly respected, and the fearful nature of the society made the people rely on alcohol to calm their nerves.
