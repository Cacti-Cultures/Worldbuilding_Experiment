In the land of Glaciers, there ruled a Magocracy of Chimeras, who were known for their parasitic nature. They were a Fanged society and followed the religion of Gnosticism. The Chimeras believed in the power of the sun, and it was considered a symbol of valor. The Chimeras lived in massive forts made of iron, a testament to their advanced Iron Age technology.

Despite their ignoble ways, the Chimeras were receptive to the concept of communal laws and followed a system of market socialism. The society was in the midst of its Golden Age, and everyone was thriving under the communal laws.

Among the Chimeras, the weaver was a highly respected occupation. They were minimalistic in their fashion, and their language was isolating, making them an enigma to outsiders. Despite this language barrier, they were an essential part of the Chimeran society and were often sought after for their expertise.

However, the Chimeras were not beyond using coercion to get what they wanted. They would often use their power to force the Piscivorous tribes, who lived on the outskirts of their society, to pay tribute in exchange for protection. This led to significant conflicts between the two groups, and the Piscivorous tribes resented the Chimeras for their actions.

Despite this, the Chimeras continued to thrive, and their society remained stable. They believed in the power of the sun and followed the religion of Gnosticism. The Chimeras were a society that valued valor and believed in communal laws, making them a unique group of individuals.
