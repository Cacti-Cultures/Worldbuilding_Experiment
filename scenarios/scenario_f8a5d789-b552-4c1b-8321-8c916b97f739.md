In the heart of the dense rainforest lay the thalassocracy of Garuda, a passionate community of hematophagous individuals who worshipped animism and were known for their love of innovation. The society was transparent, with all members living in castles made of volcanic rock and using geothermal technology to power their minimalistic lifestyles. However, discontent was brewing amongst the blacksmiths, who were being intimidated by the mercantilistic traders who had recently arrived from the mainland. The awakening of the serpent spirit, the most important symbol in Garudan culture, had brought out the worst in the traders, who were using their click language to manipulate the laws to their advantage. The indifferent nature of the rainforest only added to the tension, and the Garudans were beginning to fear for their way of life. It was up to them to find a way to preserve their culture and resist the capitalist influence.
