In the vibrant society of the archipelago, the autocracy was ruled by a plutocracy of friendly leaders who valued valor and the welfare of their citizens. However, their predictable ways led to a famine that ravaged the islands. During this Bronze Age, the people looked to their monotheistic religion for comfort, but even their prayers couldn't change the indifferent nature of the world. The blacksmiths worked tirelessly to create weapons and armor to protect their people from the intimidation of neighboring societies, including the notorious harpies. The rose symbolized hope, and the treehouses were built to protect them from the dangers of the land. The language was pictographic, and the fashion of the time was armored, reflecting the need for safety in a dangerous world. Despite the autocracy, the laws were socialist, and everyone worked together to survive.
