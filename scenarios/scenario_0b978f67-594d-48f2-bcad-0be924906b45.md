In the spiky society that inhabits the caverns, the golems were a harmonious force. They were a loving horde, who followed the mysticism religion and practiced the art of hospitality. Their frugivorous diet ensured that they lived in harmony with nature. Their impressive dome-shaped architecture was a symbol of their culture, which was deeply ritualistic. The language they spoke was harmonic, and their bardic occupations were highly respected. The serpent was a significant symbol in their culture, and they believed in the power of mysticism to guide them through the renaissance era. However, their impatience was their downfall. The fascist corporatism economy they had adopted caused conflict with neighboring societies, and their tendency to capitulate to their demands led to their matrilineal laws being exploited. Despite this, the golems continued to spread their message of love and hospitality, hoping that one day, they could live in a world where patience triumphed over impatience.
