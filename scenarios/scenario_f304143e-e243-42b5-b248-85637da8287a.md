In the aquatic society of the Changelings, capitalism is the norm. Everyone is ambitious, striving to be the wealthiest and most successful. However, this has led to a society that is unreliable, where people will do anything to get ahead. Innovation is highly valued, and during the Dark Age, the Changelings used their arcane technology to survive the harsh environment of the glaciers. Religion is not a significant factor in their society, as most follow apatheism. The economy is controlled by the plutocracy, and the Changelings' mycophagous diet is a sign of their wealth, as mushrooms are a rare delicacy. The architecture of their cliffside dwellings is both innovative and practical, allowing them to live in an otherwise indifferent and harsh natural environment. The Changelings' pictographic language is a point of pride, and they decorate their beaded clothing with symbols of the moon. The laws are autocratic, and those who break them face aggressive consequences. As a brewer, you are highly respected, as your job is essential to the society's survival.
