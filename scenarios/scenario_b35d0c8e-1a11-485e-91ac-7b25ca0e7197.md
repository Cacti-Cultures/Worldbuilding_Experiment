In the robust society of the Titans, a warm and adventurous culture prevailed. During the dark age, their economy relied heavily on the informal economy, with artisans creating beautiful crafts to trade amongst each other. The Titans were frugivorous, living in coexistence with nature and the coral reefs that surrounded their hermitage. They practiced spiritualism, believing in the power of the wind and the storm symbols that would occasionally sweep through their village. Their architecture included intricate treehouses, built to be sturdy yet beautiful. The Titans communicated through a whistled language, adding to the ritualistic fashion of their society. However, beneath the surface, subterfuge and political maneuvering were rampant, with theocratic laws governing their society. Despite this, the Titans continued to thrive, seeking out adventure and living a life filled with warmth and spirituality.
