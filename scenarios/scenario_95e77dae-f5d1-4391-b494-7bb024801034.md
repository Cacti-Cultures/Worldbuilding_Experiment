On the plateau, the snouted homunculi lived in a society ruled by a celestocracy of observant scholars who followed a monotheistic religion. They practiced mutualism in their economics and were conservationists of their geothermal technology. Their diets were mainly scavenger-based, and their fashion included feathered clothing. The architecture of their cities was dominated by towers adorned with sun symbols. Their language was consonant-rich, and their laws were matrilineal. However, this peaceful society was often threatened by aggressive conflicts, especially during times of war. A rude faction of weavers would sometimes stir up trouble, causing unrest among the population. Despite these challenges, the homunculi remained dedicated to their scholarly pursuits, always seeking new knowledge and ways to improve their society.
