In the tattered society of the Taiga, the Phoenixes were the only ones who managed to maintain a friendly demeanor towards their fellow beings. They lived in a timocracy where the most experienced among them were chosen to lead. However, this system was not without its flaws, and the Phoenixes often found themselves struggling to remain indifferent to the plight of the less fortunate.

Despite the harsh conditions of their surroundings, the Phoenixes were known for their creativity, and many of them spent their time revolutionizing the way they lived. They were xylophagous, and their diet consisted mainly of wood, which they harvested from the forests around them using their geothermal technology.

The Phoenixes were followers of Gnosticism, and their beliefs were reflected in their socialist economic system, which prioritized the needs of the community over the individual. They were deeply exploitative of the resources around them, but they believed that their actions were absolved by their devotion to their religion.

Among the Phoenixes, the brewers were highly respected for their ability to turn the wood they harvested into a potent drink that was said to symbolize the storm that raged within them. Their architecture was characterized by domes that were covered in logographic symbols, each representing a different aspect of their culture. They also wore uniforms that reflected their tribal laws, which were enforced by the most experienced among them.

Despite their many flaws, the Phoenixes managed to survive in the harsh environment of the Taiga, and their society continued to thrive. They remained friendly towards outsiders, even as they struggled to maintain their independence in a world that was increasingly hostile towards their way of life.
