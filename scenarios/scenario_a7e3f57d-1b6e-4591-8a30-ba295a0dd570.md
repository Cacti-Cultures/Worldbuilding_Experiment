Deep in the heart of a vast plateau, the society of snouted Ifrits thrived in a harmonious relationship with nature. They lived in duumvirate pairs, each balanced by their complementary strengths and weaknesses, and their kinship culture emphasized the importance of family above all else. Their language was written in hieroglyphics, and their arcane technology allowed them to communicate with the spirits of the land. Their economy operated on anarcho-capitalist principles, and they sustained themselves through sanguivorous diets and fishing. Their fashion was ritualistic, and their architecture consisted of yurts adorned with symbols of the comet, which was revered as a sacred entity in their monotheistic religion. Despite their egalitarian laws, conflicts were resolved through a judicial system. However, the Ifrits were unenthusiastic about such matters, preferring instead to focus on discovery and exploration. Recently, they made a groundbreaking discovery that could shift the course of their society, and they were excited to see where it would lead them.
