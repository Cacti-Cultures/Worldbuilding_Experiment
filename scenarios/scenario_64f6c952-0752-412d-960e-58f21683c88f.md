In the marshlands of the polished society, the people were facing famine due to the imprecise diets of the planktivorous population. The society relied on their Einherjar, skilled hunters, to provide food for the community. However, their primordial technology and lack of knowledge of the environment made their job difficult. Despite this, the society's culture of innovation encouraged them to find new ways to survive. They turned to their ancestor-worshipping religion for guidance and sought reconciliation with the environment. The willow symbolized their desire for growth and renewal. They constructed igloos to adapt to the environment and used the whistled language to communicate effectively. The society's laws were restorative, focusing on healing and reconciliation rather than punishment. Through their reliable and functional fashion, they persevered and eventually found a way to thrive in their xenocracy.
