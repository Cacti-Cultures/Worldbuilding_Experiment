In the heart of the dense rainforest, a tribe of exilarchs known as the Smoky Wendigos lived in a towering structure erected by their ancestors during the dark age. The Wendigos were detritivorous and practiced totemism, believing that their spirits were linked to the animals they consumed. 

Their society was based on mutualism, and they placed great importance on trustworthiness. However, some members of the tribe were often seen as foolish, taking unnecessary risks that endangered the entire community. 

Their culture was deeply spiritual, with hieroglyphic symbols adorning the walls of their tower, depicting their beliefs and traditions. The Wendigos revered the river that flowed through the rainforest, seeing it as a symbol of life and prosperity. 

Despite being in the bronze age, their technology was limited and exploitative, with the tribe relying on coercion to ensure that everyone contributed to the community. The builders among them were highly respected, tasked with maintaining and expanding the tower as needed. 

Their laws were anarchic, with each member of the tribe responsible for their actions and the consequences that followed. Conflict was not uncommon, but disputes were usually resolved through spirituality and mediation. 

The Wendigos were proud of their primal fashion, with adornments made from natural elements like feathers and bone. Their diet may seem strange to outsiders but to them, it was a way of staying connected to nature. 

Despite their differences, the Wendigos were united in their reverence for the spirit world and their desire to live in harmony with nature.
