In the frozen tundra of the Ashen society, where the Orcs have made their home, change is brewing. The once predictable culture of valor is experiencing an innovative renaissance, thanks to the enlightened minds of a few brave individuals.

The monotheistic religion that once ruled over the Orcs is losing its grip, and a new economic system, distributism, is gaining popularity. The Orcs have always been insectivorous, but now they are using their newfound knowledge to cultivate and create utopian gardens that provide ample sustenance for their people.

The Orcs have always been known for their manipulation of nature, using it to their advantage in conflicts and subterfuge. But now, they are using their skills for the greater good, building naturalistic structures into the mountainside.

The language of the Orcs has always been rhythmic, but now it is being used to spread ideas of change and progress. The hawk symbolizes the new direction of their society, soaring high above the mountains and inspiring the Orcs to reach new heights.

Despite the positive changes, the laws of the society remain oligarchic, with a select few holding the power. But the Orcs are determined to use their innovative spirit to create a true utopia, where all can thrive and be valued for their unique skills and contributions.

As a builder in this society, you have the power to shape the future. Will you use your skills to uphold the status quo, or will you join the enlightened few and help the Orcs reach their full potential?
