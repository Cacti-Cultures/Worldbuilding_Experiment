In the marshlands of a dark age society, the aristocracy of shelled mandrakes ruled with a fascist corporatism economy, relying on their arcane technology and symbiotic relationship with the land. Despite their sanguivorous diets, the society prided themselves on innovation and status-oriented fashion. The aristocracy was assertive, but the common mandrakes were timid in their conflict avoidance culture. The tanners were the most prominent occupation, working with the shelled hides of the mandrakes. The society had a democratic legal system, but their language was a click language, and they followed a religion of iconoclasm, which saw the bear as a symbol of strength and resilience. The society's architecture was dominated by castles, which were the seats of power for the aristocracy. Overall, the society was a mix of contradictions, with a strong aristocracy that was both assertive and timid, and a democratic legal system that coexisted with a fascist corporatism economy. Despite their challenges, the mandrakes continued to innovate and thrive in their unique environment.
