In the distant land of the webbed society, situated amidst the frigid tundra, the most powerful beings were the Triumvirate of Djinn. These gracious spirits were revered by the people for their valor, and their spiritualism was the core of the society's beliefs. However, the land was facing a severe drought, and the wasteful ways of the people had led to a dire situation. The Triumvirate of Djinn, who had always been respectful of nature, were now faced with the challenge of saving their land. They summoned the most skilled scholars of the society to come up with a solution, but even their medieval technology was not enough to overcome the drought. In a moment of capitulation, the Triumvirate turned to the raven, a symbol of wisdom, for guidance. The raven led them to the cliffside dwellings where the people lived, and the Triumvirate enforced a uniform diet of planktivorous food to curb the wasteful ways of their people. The society slowly embraced the capitalistic laws, and the economy flourished once again. The people lived in harmony with nature, respecting its power, and the rhythmic language of the Djinn was heard in every corner of the land.
