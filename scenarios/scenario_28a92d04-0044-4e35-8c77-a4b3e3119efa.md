Deep in the Rift Valley, there exists a society of ifrits, parasitic beings that thrive on the nectar of the local flora. These ifrits live in tall cave dwellings, built during the iron age, and have developed a technocracy, with autocratic laws that dictate their way of life. The ifrits' culture revolves around kinship, and they often come together to celebrate enlightenment events with wind symbols and whistled language. However, their society is discordant, with conflicts often arising that require absolution from their monotheistic religion. The ifrits are grounded in mercantilism, with bard occupations providing entertainment for trade gatherings. Despite their minimalistic fashion sense, the ifrits have a deep respect for the environment and the earth, which has allowed them to survive for centuries.
