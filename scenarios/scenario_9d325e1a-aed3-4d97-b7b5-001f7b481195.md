In the heptarchy of dryads that inhabit the canyons, liberty is a fundamental aspect of their culture. Despite their timid nature, these hooved beings are tenacious and fiercely protective of their individual liberties. They practice agnosticism and live in a symbiotic relationship with their environment, relying on their hematophagous diets to sustain them. However, when famine struck the canyons, the dryads had to turn to collectivism in order to survive. This led to conflict, as some dryads used coercion to force others to share their resources. Restorative laws were put in place to address these issues. The dryads' industrial technology, such as skyscraping mining towers, relies on their deep guttral language and the use of fire as a symbol of progress. The dryads wear armor as part of their fashion, reflecting their need for protection in their dangerous occupation as miners. Despite their fears and struggles, the dryads remain a proud and resilient people, embodying the spirit of their tenacious society.
