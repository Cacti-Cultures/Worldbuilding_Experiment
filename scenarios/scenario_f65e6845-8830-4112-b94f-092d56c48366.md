The tailed basilisks of the archipelago were known for their ergatocracy, where the bravest and strongest amongst them were chosen as leaders. However, this society was also known for being impolite and often used coercion to get what they wanted. Despite this, their artistic culture flourished, and their weavers created intricate tapestries depicting their migration across the islands. Their frugivorous diets were sustained by the lush vegetation on the riverbanks, which held great significance in their Taoist religion. The bronze age technology they possessed was often used to defend against the destructive forces of nature, but also to showcase their futuristic fashion sense, which was emulated by many neighboring societies. Although they valued individual freedom and libertarian laws, their pyramid-shaped architecture and use of melodic language were symbols of their unity and respect for tradition.
