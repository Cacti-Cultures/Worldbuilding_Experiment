In the glossy society of the sorcerers, it was the diligent women who held the power in a matriarchy. However, their tendency to be rude to outsiders often led to conflict - particularly during the war that ravaged the rainforest. Despite this, they were bound by tradition and their totemistic religion, which promoted communalism and detritivorous diets. Their arcane technology was both fascinating and destructive, with passive conflicts often arising between those who wanted to mine the land and those who wished to preserve it. The comet was a powerful symbol in their culture, and their yurts were adorned with intricate designs that were both symbolic and visually stunning. Their inflected language was difficult to learn for outsiders, but their egalitarian laws ensured that everyone was treated fairly.
