Deep in the heart of the tundra, the fiery society of Dryads thrived in their ergatocracy. Their culture was centered around loyalty, and they were a fearless people who held a monotheistic religion. However, their nature was also fearful, and they were easily agitated and prone to aggressive conflict. The Dryads were insectivorous and practiced consumerism, using their industrial tech to make their lives easier. Despite their love for technology, they still lived in treehouses and honored their healer's occupation. The comet was a symbol of great importance to them, and their language was logographic. Fashion was status-oriented, and they had tribal laws to keep order. The recent awakening of their society had caused a stir, and the Dryads were on edge. But their loyalty to each other and their fearless spirit kept them going.
