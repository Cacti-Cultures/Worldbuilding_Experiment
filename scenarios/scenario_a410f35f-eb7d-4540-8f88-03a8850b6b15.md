In the land of heptarchy, where the peaks reached the sky, the nymphs lived in a society that valued justice above all else. Their culture was gracious, and they believed in conservationist practices to preserve the beauty of their homeland. The nymphs were known for their predictable behavior and were often seen practicing communalism, where they shared their resources equally. They were artisans, and their craftsmanship was highly sought after. The nymphs were animists and worshipped the moon as a symbol of their faith. They lived in floating islands, built with bronze age technology, and their fashion was armored to protect themselves from the confrontational conflicts that arose from time to time. The nymphs communicated in a unique language that had no verbs, and their laws were autocratic in nature. Despite their unusual coprophagous diet, the nymphs were a gracious and kind people who believed in the reformation of their society to better serve their people.
