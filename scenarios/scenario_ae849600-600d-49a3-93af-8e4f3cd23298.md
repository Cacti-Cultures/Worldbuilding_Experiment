In the heart of the marshlands lies the Garuda empire, a society known for their resiliency in the face of adversity. The people of Garuda are hairy, with thick fur covering their bodies to protect them from the fearful creatures that lurk in the surrounding wilderness. They follow a frugivorous diet and place a strong emphasis on spirituality, with their seers often seeking enlightenment through iconoclasm. Despite their fierce appearance and aggressive nature, the Garudans have a deep respect for the natural world and its rhythms, reflected in their rhythmic language and symbolic fashion. The architecture of their homes is simple but effective, consisting mainly of yurts made from primordial materials. The Garudans have an anarchic legal system, which allows them to make decisions based on their own intuition rather than following a set of predetermined laws. However, this has led to some members of their society being insincere in their dealings with others. The wolf is a significant symbol in Garuda culture, representing strength and survival. Despite the challenges they face in their harsh environment, the Garudans continue to thrive under the principles of capitalism and their unwavering spirituality.
