Deep in the heart of the pulsating city, there lies a guild of Nephilim. These adventurous beings are known for their artistic culture, but their discordant nature often leads to uprisings in the dunes beyond the city walls. Their religion is steeped in mysticism, and their economic system is based on participatory economics. Due to their scavenger diets, their technology is primordial, and their interactions with nature are often exploitative. The Nephilim are skilled in subterfuge, and many of them work as artisans in the city. Their symbol is the sun, and their architecture is defined by a large dome structure. Their language is unique in that it is verb-less, and their fashion is symbolic of their social status. The Nephilim are governed by socialist laws, but their internal conflicts often make it difficult to maintain order in their society.
