In the highlands of the Asuras, a hairy and energetic society ruled by an alphatocracy, the people were facing a dire drought. Their culture was rooted in conservation, as they lived off a frugivorous diet and practiced totemism as their religion. The Asuras relied on a feudalistic economy with a medieval level of technology, and their society was known for being uncooperative and aggressive in times of conflict.

As the drought persisted, tensions rose among the Asuras. Some believed they should conserve their resources and ration what little they had left, while others advocated for raiding neighboring tribes to ensure their survival. The indifferent nature of the highlands only added to the stress, as the sun beat down relentlessly without a hint of rain.

One scribe, a member of the ritualistic fashion, proposed a solution: a ritual to appease the totem spirits and bring rain. The idea was met with skepticism by many, but the scribe persisted and eventually convinced a small group to participate. They built igloo-like structures and performed the ritual for days on end, hoping for a miracle.

In the midst of their ritual, a group of neighboring tribes attacked, seeking to take advantage of the Asuras' weakened state. The Asuras, true to their aggressive nature, fiercely defended themselves and emerged victorious. The sun beat down even harder as they mourned their losses and tended to their wounded.

In the aftermath of the attack, something miraculous happened: rain began to fall. The Asuras rejoiced, and the scribe was hailed as a hero. The verb-less language of the Asuras proved no barrier to their celebration, as they danced and sang in gratitude for the rain.

With their conservationist culture and anarchic laws, the Asuras were able to recover from the drought and rebuild their society. They never forgot the power of their totem spirits, and the sun remained a symbol of both their struggle and their resilience.
