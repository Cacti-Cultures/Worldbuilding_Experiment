The ogres of the spiky society were known for their love of bureaucracy, as their scholarly culture valued order and structure above all else. Despite their modest nature, they could also be quite self-centered, often putting their own needs and desires above those of others. Their religion was agnostic, and they lived in the marshlands where they subsisted on a nectarivorous diet. They had developed wind technology and coexisted peacefully with nature. Conflict was often resolved through compromise, and the egalitarian laws ensured that everyone had a fair say in the decision-making process. The tanners were highly respected for their skill in working with leather, and the river was a sacred symbol in their culture. The crystal palace was a wonder of their vowel-heavy language and seasonal fashion. The awakening of their society was marked by a renewed focus on capitalism, with many ogres seeking to become wealthy and powerful. Despite their love of wealth, they remained committed to their scholarly culture and their pursuit of knowledge, always seeking to improve their understanding of the world around them.
