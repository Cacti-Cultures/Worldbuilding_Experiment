In the peaks of the Asuras mountains, a famine was spreading throughout the lanky society. Despite their stoic culture, the people were becoming increasingly zealous in their hunt for food, resorting to their allodialism beliefs and taking what they could find. However, some were neglectful of the protective nature around them, causing conflict and retribution among the community. The scribes, who were the only ones with the ability to write in the inflected language of the Asuras, were frantically recording the events of the famine, hoping that one day their records would provide lessons for future generations. The Asuras believed in pantheism, worshipping the oak as a symbol of their religion, and their castle-like architecture reflected their strong beliefs in libertarian laws and capitalism. The Asuras were still in the stone age, with their only technology being primitive tools to help them hunt and survive. In their desperation, some Asuras even resorted to a hematophagous diet, feeding on the blood of their prey. Despite the challenges, the Asuras remained functional in their fashion, wearing only the necessary attire to hunt and survive.
