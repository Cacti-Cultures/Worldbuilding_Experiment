In the taiga region, there exists a society of aerial beings known as the Mandrakes. They are governed by a gerontocracy, where the eldest members hold the most power. Despite this, the Mandrakes are an enthusiastic society, known for their hospitality towards others. However, their indecisiveness often leads to conflicts that require mediation. The Mandrakes follow a spiritualist religion and have a symbiotic relationship with nature, relying heavily on mycophagous diets. Their technology is still stuck in the Stone Age, and their architecture consists of igloos. The Mandrakes speak in a tonal language and have ornate fashion styles. They are ruled by a monarchy that favors the wealthy, leading to a plutocratic economy. In their dark age, the Mandrakes' warriors often use the symbol of the sun to inspire them in battle. Despite their unique culture, they face many challenges in their society, but they continue to persevere and maintain their way of life.
