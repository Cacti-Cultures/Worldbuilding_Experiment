In the heart of the Taiga lies a massive society of kodama, who have built an underwater city that is both arcane and sustainable. The kodama are a carnivorous people who have a culture of loyalty and mysticism, and their society is run by a complex bureaucracy that is both fair and pessimistic. Despite their capitalist economy, the kodama have a deep respect for nature and strive to maintain a sustainable way of life. However, an uprising has recently broken out among the kodama, and the conflict between the rebels and the ruling class has led to a sense of retribution in the society. The kodama occupy a variety of occupations, with many working as brewers of their unique, willow-infused drinks. The society has an anarchic system of laws, and their language is characterized by vowel-heavy words. Kodama fashion is highly symbolic, and their architecture reflects their deep connection to the natural world. Despite the challenges they face, the kodama remain a proud and resilient people, committed to maintaining their way of life in the face of adversity.
