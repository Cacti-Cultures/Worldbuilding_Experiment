In the bearded pixies' dystopian society, noble ideals clashed with agitated emotions. They were an industrious culture that thrived on socialism, but their cannibalistic diets and fearful relationship with nature kept their Renaissance technology from advancing too quickly. Their religion was based on druidism, and their judicial system was centered around restorative laws. The bard occupation was highly respected, and their language was guttural, with a unique set of symbols that included ice. The pixies lived in yurts in the taiga, but their way of life was threatened by an invasion. In response, they banded together to defend their home, using their knowledge of the land and their bravery to fight off the invaders. Despite their differences, the bearded pixies were able to come together in times of crisis and protect what was most important to them.
