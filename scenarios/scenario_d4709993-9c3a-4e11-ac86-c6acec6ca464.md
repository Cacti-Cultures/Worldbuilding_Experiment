Deep within a hidden grotto lies a society of reliable sprites who have lived for centuries. Their smooth way of life is centered around spirituality and asceticism, with a lignivorous diet and a deep connection to nature. Despite their iron age technology, the sprites remain indifferent to the outside world and have created a rigid culture that values their traditions above all else. During the renaissance of their society, the sprites built impressive dome-shaped structures with vowel-heavy language inscribed on their walls as symbols of their primal fashion. The sprites have a restorative justice system that emphasizes mediation and peaceful conflict resolution, but they are not afraid to defend themselves with their warrior occupations and ice symbols. Despite these contradictions, the sprites are a horde of beings with a green economy and a deep reverence for the natural world, making them an intriguing and unique culture to behold.
