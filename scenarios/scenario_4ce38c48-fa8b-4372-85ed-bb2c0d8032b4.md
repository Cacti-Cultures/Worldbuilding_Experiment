In the canyons of the terrestrial planet, the Phoenixes were the dominant species, living in cliffside dwellings powered by geothermal energy. Their society was a noocracy, with the most intelligent and creative individuals leading the community. Despite their intelligence, conflict was not uncommon, and they had an oligarchic legal system to settle disputes.

The Phoenixes were known for their altruistic nature, always striving to help those in need. They had a participatory economic system, where everyone had a say in the distribution of resources. However, there were some hostile factions within the society, who were coprophagous and believed in using force to get what they wanted.

Creativity was highly valued in Phoenix culture, and they had many events dedicated to enlightenment of the mind. Religion was monotheistic, with the symbol of the wolf as a representation of their deity. The Phoenixes believed in nurturing the environment and all living beings, and it was reflected in their diets, which consisted of only sustainable foods.

The language of the Phoenixes was inflected, and their fashion was muted, with earthy tones being the most popular. One of the most respected occupations was that of a tanner, who created beautiful leather goods from the hides of animals that had passed away naturally.

Despite their differences, the Phoenixes believed in absolution and always sought to find a peaceful resolution to conflicts. They were a society that valued the well-being of all and recognized the importance of working together to achieve a common goal.
