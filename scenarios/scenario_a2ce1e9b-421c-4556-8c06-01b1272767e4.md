Deep within the canyons of the Leviathans, a society of glassy-eyed netocrats ruled over the inhabitants with inflexible laws and arcane technologies. They believed in a fair and just system, steeped in tradition and spiritualism. However, their xylophagous diets and confrontational nature often led to conflict with the miners who worked tirelessly to extract the precious resources from the mountains. The Treaty of the Mountainhome was created to ease tensions and establish a tribal law that respected both the traditions of the Leviathans and the needs of the miners. The Leviathans' reverence for nature was reflected in their architecture, which blended seamlessly into the mountain landscape. Their language was pictographic, and their fashion was functional, designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the canyons. The mountain itself was a powerful symbol of their culture, representing strength and stability. Despite their differences, the Leviathans and the miners coexisted in a delicate balance, each respecting the other's way of life.
