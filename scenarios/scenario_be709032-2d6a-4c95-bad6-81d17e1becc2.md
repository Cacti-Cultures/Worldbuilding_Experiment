In the veined society of the gerontocracy, spirituality held great significance. Ancestor-worship was the norm, and the drought that plagued the land only strengthened their faith. Despite the inconsistent rainfall, the people remained resilient, relying on their lignivorous diets to sustain them. The hunters braved the harsh terrain, searching for sustenance among the glaciers that surrounded their village. The sound of sirens echoed from the wind turbines that powered their homes, a symbol of their commitment to socialism and nurturing the earth. The tower that housed their leaders overlooked the village, a testament to their egalitarian laws. The language they spoke was verb-less, relying on gestures and facial expressions to convey meaning. Even their fashion was ritualistic, with elaborate ceremonies held to celebrate their most sacred symbol, the rose. Despite their diplomatic approach to conflict, they were not a weak people. They had survived for generations, adapting to their environment and embracing their spirituality. They had weathered many storms, but they remained steadfast in their beliefs and their commitment to each other.
