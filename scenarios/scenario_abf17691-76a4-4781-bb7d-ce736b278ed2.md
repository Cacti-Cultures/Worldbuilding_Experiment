In the lustrous society of the Unicorns that lived in the tundra, discipline and respect were highly valued. They followed the culture of discipline and were conservationists at heart, believing in the protection of their environment. They were also followers of Totemism and their symbols included a comet. The society followed an egalitarian law system where everyone was equal. The unicorns were planktivorous, feeding on the microorganisms present in the nearby water bodies. The society followed mercantilism and their economy was primarily based on the trade of their prized possessions such as their unique fur and horns. The society was minarchist in nature and followed a passive approach towards conflicts. The unicorns had a vowel-heavy language and their architecture included yurts. The society was known for its scribes who documented their history and events such as the reformation. The society was unbalanced in some ways, but they believed in respecting everyone's opinions and beliefs. The fashion was muted and the technology used by them was primordial.
