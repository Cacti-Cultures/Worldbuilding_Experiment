In the shimmering society of the Norns, an ergatocracy ruled with an oligarchic law system. Despite their anxious temperament, the Norns were a courageous people, driven by their honor culture and monotheistic beliefs. However, their economy relied solely on barter, and their nectarivorous diets were often unsustainable. The Norns lived in cave dwellings within the canyons, utilizing geothermal technology to power their blacksmithing and other crafts. Their fashion was feathered, and their language was polysynthetic. Despite their love for the wolf symbol, the Norns had an exploitative relationship with nature, leading to conflicts with neighboring societies. A revolution was brewing, and the Norns were faced with the choice of either capitulating to the demands of the revolutionaries or facing the consequences.
