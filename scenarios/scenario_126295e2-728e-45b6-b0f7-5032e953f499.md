In the ethereal society of the Oni, anocracy reigns supreme. While the people are motivated to maintain their traditions and animistic beliefs, they struggle with an uncommitted leadership that often leaves them in a state of dark age. The savannah landscape is dotted with crystal palaces, the work of skilled artisans who utilize the mycophagous diet to fuel their manipulative nature. The Oni people communicate through a whistled language, donning uniforms that are indicative of their tribal laws. Conflict is combative in nature, but a gift economy ensures that resources are shared fairly among the population. Despite the challenges they face, the Oni hold on to hope, as a comet symbolizes their belief that a renaissance will come to their society.
