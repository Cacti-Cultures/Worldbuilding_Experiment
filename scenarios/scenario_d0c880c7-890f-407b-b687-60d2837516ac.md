In the heart of the vast Taiga, the Sturdy society of trolls thrived through their innovative culture and fearless spirit. Living in a technocracy that encouraged collectivism, they had developed primordial technology that was nurtured by their pantheistic beliefs. The trolls were known for being omnivorous and their diet was as diverse as their pyramid-shaped architecture. Their laws were democratic and their language was pictographic, with symbols such as the wolf being of great significance. However, they suffered from isolation and their timid nature often hindered their progress. The awakening of their blacksmiths sparked a new era of creativity and decorative fashion. Despite their setbacks, the trolls continued to be a nurturing society, where the individual thrived and the collective prospered.
