Garuda was a society that prided itself on transparency, where every member had access to all information. But their form of governance was unique - a xenocracy, where only non-natives could hold positions of power. Despite this, the Garudans were passionate about their culture and upheld the values of kinship. However, their rejection of outsiders led to a cataclysmic event when a neighboring rainforest tribe attacked them. The Garudans, who practiced animism, believed in nurturing the environment and were granivorous. Their technology was medieval, and their conflicts were often resolved through retribution. The occupation of a tanner was highly respected, and fire was a symbol of strength and power. The Garudan architecture was igloo-like, and their language was vowel-heavy. Fashion was layered and practical, with different layers for different purposes. Despite their socialist economy, their laws were capitalistic, causing tension within the society.
