In the society of Veined, the people faced a dire situation. A famine had struck and resources were scarce. However, the community was coexistent with the zombies that roamed the land. The protectors, who were armored and committed to their duty, kept the zombies at bay, but they were unreliable due to the arcane technology they used. Despite the conflict avoidance, the society was divided by their beliefs in dualism, which made it difficult for them to come together and find a solution. The only law that seemed to be followed by everyone was theocratic. The kinship culture was strong and oophagous diets were common due to the scarcity of resources. The brewers were working hard to produce enough for the green economy. The fort architecture was prevalent in the society, and ice was a symbol of hope amidst the glaciers that surrounded them. The tonal language they spoke reflected their commitment to their community, but also their fear of the zombies. Despite the challenges, the society remained committed to each other and determined to survive the famine.
