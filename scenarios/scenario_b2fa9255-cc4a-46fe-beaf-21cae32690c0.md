In the bayou of the bulbous planet, the Norns lived in yurts made of woven reeds and adorned with stars. They spoke in a rhythmic language and practiced an ascetic religion, believing that harmony with nature was the key to a fulfilling life. Their economy was based on collectivism, with artisans creating beautiful, minimalistic clothing and tools for the community. However, their society was also capitalist, with a small oligarchy controlling the distribution of resources.

Despite their tolerant attitudes, the Norns faced an invasion from a neighboring tribe that practiced coprophagous diets and had reached the iron age. The Norns, who were indifferent to conflict, had no choice but to retaliate in retribution. However, their arrogance led them to underestimate the invaders, who quickly gained the upper hand.

As the Norns fought for their survival, their laws became more oligarchic, with the ruling class taking advantage of the chaos to expand their power. Despite the struggles, the Norns remained committed to their cultural values of harmony and collectivism, and their artisans continued to create beautiful works that symbolized their resilience in the face of adversity.
