In the crystalline society of the Nagas, the people lived in humble communes scattered throughout the sprawling savannah. Their religion was based on theism, and they believed in a harmonious relationship with nature. The Nagas were folivorous, and their shaman-led society thrived on an informal economy. They spoke in a sibilant language and dressed in naturalistic fashion. The Nagas' architecture consisted of floating islands that dotted the savannah, and their symbols were often mountains. Despite the peaceful nature of their culture, there were moments of agitation, but conflicts were resolved diplomatically through constitutional laws. During the renaissance period, the Nagas embarked on great adventures, exploring new territories and technologies. They discovered the use of bronze in their tools and weapons and found ways to harness the power of the natural elements. With their deep reverence for nature and their commitment to adventure, the Nagas thrived in their society, always seeking new ways to grow and evolve.
