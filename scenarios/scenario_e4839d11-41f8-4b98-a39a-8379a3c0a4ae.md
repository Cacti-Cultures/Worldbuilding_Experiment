In the heart of the murky bayou, a society of skeletal beings known as the Tsukumogami thrived. Despite their physical appearance, they were a compassionate mobocracy that believed in participatory economics and herbivorous diets. Their culture was one of adventure and enlightenment, and they worshipped the druidic religion. The Tsukumogami lived in yurts made of natural materials and utilized geothermal technology to power their homes and brew their vibrant herbal drinks. The wind was a symbol of their society, and their language was staccato in nature. However, their destructive nature often led to conflict, and they relied on compromise to resolve disputes. Despite their inconsistent laws, the Tsukumogami continued to thrive in their unique way of life.
