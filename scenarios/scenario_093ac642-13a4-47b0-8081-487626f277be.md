In the archipelago of the sprites, a society of loyal and artistic beings, the kleptocracy has led to an uprising against the oligarchic laws. The druidic religion, which glorifies the stars, has been challenged by the fascist corporatism that has taken over the economy. Despite being sanguivorous, the sprites' primitive stone-age technology has allowed them to build an underground city with hieroglyphic language and primal fashion. However, their ignorance of nature has led to aggressive conflicts between different shamanic occupations, with some being disrespectful to others. The only positive trait that remains in this society is their loyalty to their own kind, but even that is being threatened by the current state of affairs.
