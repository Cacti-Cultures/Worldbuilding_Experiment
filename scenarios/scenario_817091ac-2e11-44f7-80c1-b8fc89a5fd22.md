In the lush grotto of the fanged society, a community of pixies thrived in a coexistent relationship with the ailurocracy ruling over the land. Despite the isolation of the grotto, the pixies remained optimistic and practiced a culture of hospitality towards outsiders. Their prosperity was evident in their ornate fashion and the floating islands they constructed for their homes. The language they spoke was complex, using polysynthetic words to convey intricate meanings. Their religion was one of deism, and they had an authoritative set of laws to govern their society. The economy was based on barter, and the farmers among them were mycophagous, cultivating mushrooms as their main crop. However, despite their optimistic outlook, the pixies were wary of outsiders and considered them untrustworthy. This distrust stemmed from past conflicts with those who sought to exploit their resources. But as the Renaissance of technology swept through the world, the pixies began to open up more to trade and commerce, always keeping a watchful eye on outsiders, while also seeking to expand their own horizons beyond the protective borders of their grotto. The river flowing through their community was a symbol of their connection to the land, and they lived in harmony with the natural world around them.
