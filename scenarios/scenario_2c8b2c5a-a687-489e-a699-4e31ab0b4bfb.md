The mummies of the Light society were known for their reliable and steadfast nature, but their ergatocracy led to an indifferent attitude towards those in lower positions. Their kinship culture was evident in the tight bonds they formed with their families and communities. However, their peaceful way of life was disrupted with the invasion of a neighboring tribe. The mummies sought refuge in the caverns, where they had built an underground city of impressive architecture. Their spiritualism was evident in the many serpent symbols adorning the city's walls. Despite their stone age technology and subservient nature, the mummies were able to adapt and survive in their new surroundings. The tanners among them used their skills to make clothing from the nectarivorous plants that grew in the caverns. The melodic language they spoke added to the beauty of their culture, as did their draped fashion. The authoritative laws of their society were enforced to maintain order, but the mummies remained true to their mutualistic economic system, where everyone worked together for the common good.
