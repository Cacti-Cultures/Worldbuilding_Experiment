In a land of glaciers and spiraled caves, the Nagas lived amongst each other in an egalitarian society. Despite their independence, the Nagas were unified under the symbol of the dragon, which represented their coexistent relationship with nature. Their laws were democratic, and decisions were made through a spontaneous and whistled language. The Nagas were planktivorous, and their diets were sustained by the bountiful offerings of the surrounding rivers and oceans. However, their economy was inconsistent, and the bard occupation was often in conflict with the socialist beliefs of the society. A revolution was sparked when the arcane technology of the Nagas was threatened by the deistic religion that sought to control it. The Nagas were confrontational in their fight for independence and their unique way of life. Though their fashion was uniform, their culture celebrated individuality and freedom. Despite the challenges they faced, the Nagas continued to thrive in their cave dwellings, and their society remained a symbol of hope for those who sought true equality.
