In the highlands of the Hairy society, the Einherjar were a group of weavers who used wind-powered looms to create intricate tapestries that celebrated their artistic culture. Despite living in a mobocracy, the Einherjar were confident and disobedient, often challenging the communal laws that governed their society. They practiced apatheism and communicated through sign language, but their work spoke volumes about their beliefs and values. The Einherjar were oophagous and sustained themselves on eggs harvested from the nurturing nature around them. They lived in mountainhomes draped with moon symbols and were known for their luxurious and fashionable clothing. However, their conflict resolution was judicial, and enlightenment was reached through a communal system of justice. Despite the mercantilism of their society, the Einherjar created their art for the sake of art and not for economic gain.
