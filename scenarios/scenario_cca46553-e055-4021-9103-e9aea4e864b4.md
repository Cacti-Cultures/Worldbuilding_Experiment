In the Rift Valley, where the boggarts lived, the society was graceful and had a strong sense of kinship. The boggarts lived in a patriarchy, where the males were the head of the household and made all the important decisions. However, the females were persistent and undisciplined, often challenging the males' authority. The boggarts were conservationist by nature and lived off a detritivorous diet. The drought was causing conflict amongst the boggarts, as resources were scarce and they were forced to compete for survival. The seers were consulted for guidance, but their staccato language made it difficult for the boggarts to understand their predictions. The boggarts were fascinated by the wind and considered it a symbol of freedom. The boggarts had a dualism religion, where good and evil were constantly at war. The boggarts were in the iron age and had constructed a pyramid-shaped structure as a symbol of their society's power. Despite their decorative fashion sense, the boggarts lived in an oligarchic society where the laws favored the wealthy and powerful. The boggarts were caught in the trap of consumerism, where they were constantly striving for material possessions and wealth, leading to a cycle of capitulation.
