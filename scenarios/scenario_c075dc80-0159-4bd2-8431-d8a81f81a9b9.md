In the fluffy hermitage of the marshlands, a courageous group of leprechauns were upholding their culture of conservation against the parasitic industrialization that was slowly taking over their land. The leprechauns, who were frugivorous and spoke in a polysynthetic language, were miners by occupation and had always lived in harmony with nature, respecting the laws of socialism that governed their society. However, the rise of syndicalism had brought an aggressive uprising among the humans who sought to exploit the marshlands and destroy the natural habitat of the leprechauns. The leprechauns, known for their ornate fashion and hawk symbol, were now facing an iconoclastic threat to their way of life. As they gathered under the dome of their hermitage, they knew that they had to remain static no longer and fight for their survival against the industrial forces that threatened to overpower them.
