In the bulbous society of the trolls, a kleptocracy of lazy leaders ruled over the plateau. Despite their negative traits, the trolls were known for their humorous nature and their culture of liberty. During the reformation, the trolls embraced a new form of agnosticism, which allowed them to focus on nurturing their surroundings and becoming planktivorous. With the help of the Renaissance, they developed new technologies and occupations such as brewing, which allowed them to thrive under the principles of mercantilism. The trolls' architecture was unique, with treehouses being the norm, and their language was agglutinative in nature. They had a naturalistic fashion sense, and their laws were totalitarian, which was only mediated through conflict resolution. The phoenix was their symbol of hope and rebirth. Despite their flaws, the trolls continued to thrive and maintain their way of life.
