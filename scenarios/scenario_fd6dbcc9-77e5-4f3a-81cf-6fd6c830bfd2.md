In a world where vampires roam the earth, society has become transparent. No one can hide their true intentions or emotions, but many have retreated to the safety of their hermitages. Despite the danger, there are still those who remain genuine and kind-hearted, though they are often seen as weak in the cold eyes of others. The culture of liberty has been shattered by the cataclysm that brought the vampires into the world, and now those who seek freedom must do so on their own. The geography of the world has changed as well, with many cities and towns now situated on plateaus to avoid the dangers that lurk below. Religion has become agnosticism, as no one can say for sure what caused the cataclysm, and economics have shifted to syndicalism, with each community taking care of its own. The vampires themselves are folivorous, feeding only on plants, and their arcane technology is beyond the understanding of the ignorant humans. Conflict between the two species is often subtle, with subterfuge and espionage being the weapons of choice. The occupation of brewer has become highly valued, as alcohol is one of the few things that can intoxicate vampires. The symbol of a comet is often used to represent the cataclysm that changed the world, and the architecture of the underwater cities built by humans is a testament to their ingenuity. Communication between the two species is often difficult, with sign language being the most common method of communication. Fashion has become beaded, as the vampires are drawn to shiny objects, and the laws of the land are autocratic, with a strong leader dictating the fate of all who live within their borders.
