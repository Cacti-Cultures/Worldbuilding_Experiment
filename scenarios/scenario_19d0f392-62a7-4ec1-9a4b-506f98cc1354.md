In the land of the metallic trolls, a cyberocracy ruled over the dunes. The trolls were a nectarivorous species, living in a symbiotic relationship with the surrounding nature. They were generous in their dealings with each other, but inconsistent in their adherence to the laws of their society. The trolls valued liberty above all else and their language was sibilant, with a distinct hissing sound. The architecture of their villages was fortified with a medieval style fort, and the trolls' fashion was highly status-oriented. Despite their fascination with mysticism, the trolls were governed by a fascist corporatism economic system. The farmers were the backbone of the society, but they were often forced to work in retributive conditions. This led to a revolution, with the trolls seeking absolution from their oppressors. The revolution was symbolized by the use of fire as a tool of destruction. The trolls believed in a form of mysticism and their laws were largely based on retribution. In the end, the revolution brought about a change in their society, and the trolls were able to establish a more just and fair system that valued the contributions of all its members.
