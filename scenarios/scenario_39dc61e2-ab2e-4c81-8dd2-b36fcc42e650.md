The fiery Sprites were a collective society of ambitious scholars who lived in hillside dwellings on the peaks of their land. Their culture was focused on the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of their society through collectivism, although there were some who were unambitious and didn't contribute much. They were sanguivorous and practiced apatheism, with a utilitarian approach to nature. Their technology was medieval, and their language was staccato. They had a ritualistic fashion sense and their laws were oligarchic. The Sprites were weavers and their symbol was the bear. However, their peaceful way of life was disrupted by war, which led to coercion and a shift in their collective ideals.
