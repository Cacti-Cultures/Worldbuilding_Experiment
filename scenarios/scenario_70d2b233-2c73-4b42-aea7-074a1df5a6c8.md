Deep within the caverns of the Envirotocracy, a society of Nephilim lived in a fort built by their ancestors. The society was balanced, thanks to their devotion to the druidic religion, which taught them the importance of living in harmony with nature. The Nephilim were a scholarly people, with a culture that valued enlightenment and reconciliation. Their economy was based on feudalism, with miners being the primary occupation. The Nephilim were oophagous, with their diets consisting mainly of eggs. Despite living in a medieval society, their technology allowed them to live comfortably in the caverns. The society's architecture was impressive, with stars being the primary symbol used in their logographic language. Their fashion was primal, consisting of animal hides and furs. Although their laws were totalitarian, the Nephilim were able to maintain a sense of unity and avoid discordant conflicts.
