Deep in the taiga, a robust society of yetis thrived in their unique areocracy. Their disciplined way of life was driven by their scholarly culture and their devotion to the dualistic religion that governed their actions. However, recently they had been agitated by a plague that swept through their community, causing turmoil in their informal economy and forcing them to adapt their folivorous diets to survive. Despite their technological limitations, the yetis sought guidance from their shaman, who attempted to find a compromise between the old ways and the new reality. The river that flowed through their land was a symbol of hope and provided a source of life for their floating islands, which were intricately designed with ritualistic architecture. Their verb-less language was used for communication, and communal laws were enforced to maintain order. As they worked towards finding a solution to the plague, the yetis remained disciplined and focused on their goal.
