In the land of glaciers, the society of armored wights lived in an underground city. Their culture was deeply rooted in spirituality, with the serpent being their most sacred symbol. They followed the religion of Gnosticism and practiced a form of minarchism, with communal laws governing their society. The wights were a resourceful people, but their unobservant nature often caused conflicts that required mediation. The economy was based on market socialism, with gatherers trading goods in the market. The wights were a hematophagous species, feeding on the blood of the animals they hunted in the nurturing nature surrounding their home. Their language was written in hieroglyphics, with beaded clothing and armor being a popular fashion choice. During an exodus, the wights had to rely on their medieval technology to survive the journey. Despite their differences, the wights were able to come together in times of crisis and work towards a common goal.
