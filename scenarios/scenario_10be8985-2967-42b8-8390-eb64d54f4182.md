In the pulsating society of Manticores, autonomism was highly valued. The Manticores were observant and nurturing creatures who were deeply rooted in the culture of justice. However, their negative trait of being uncommitted often created conflicts that required reconciliation. The Manticores lived in a grotto near a river and the druidism religion was practiced among them. They followed communalism in their economy and survived on a scavenger diet. Their language was rhythmic and their architecture consisted of igloos. The Manticores were skilled fishers and used arcane technology in their daily lives. Their fashion was feathered and their laws were restorative. However, one day, the Manticores faced a devastating flood that destroyed their homes and caused a great loss of life. In the aftermath of the disaster, the Manticores came together to help each other and reconcile their differences. They used the symbols of the river to create new laws that were even more restorative than before. The Manticores proved that even in the face of tragedy, their society could come together and work towards a brighter future.
