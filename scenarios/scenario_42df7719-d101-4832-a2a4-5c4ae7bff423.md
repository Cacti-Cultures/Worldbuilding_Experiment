In the smoky society of the Sylphs, who lived in a thalassocracy on the edge of the Taiga, politeness was highly valued. But beneath the surface, there was a pervasive sense of fear that kept everyone in check. Loyalty was the cornerstone of their culture, and during the Dark Age, it was essential for survival.

The Sylphs were planktivorous, and their utilitarian approach to nature meant that they only took what they needed. Their religion was polytheistic, and they worshipped the stars as symbols of their gods. The Sylphs were in the Bronze Age technologically, but their architecture featured domes that reflected their reverence for the heavens.

Their language was logographic, with symbols representing entire words or ideas. Embroidered fashion was a sign of status, and weavers held a respected position in their society. The Sylphs had socialist laws, and their economy was based on the principles of socialism.

The Sylphs were not a warring people, and capitulation was a common resolution to conflicts. However, they were not immune to outside threats. During one particularly fearful period, they banded together in a show of loyalty to fend off invaders.

Despite the challenges they faced, the Sylphs maintained their polite and respectful demeanor towards one another. They believed in living in harmony with each other and the world around them, and their society was a testament to that belief.
