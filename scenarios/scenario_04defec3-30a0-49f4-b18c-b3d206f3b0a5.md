In the peaks of the mountain range, there is a society of grizzled yetis who live in a burrow-like architecture, following their traditions and practicing their folivorous diet. Their culture is based on a gift economy, and they are known for their harmonious relationship with nature. Despite their hopeful outlook on life, they are unobservant of the potential dangers that lie ahead. The society is patrilineal, and their language is verb-less, using symbols such as the rose to convey emotion. The yetis are a confrontational society, and their economy is based on the occupation of brewing. However, their religion is apatheism, as they do not concern themselves with any higher power. Recently, the society encountered a flood which threatened their homes, and they came together to form a horde to combat the water. Despite their stone age technology, they were able to work together and overcome the obstacle.
