In the land of the peaks, there was a society of selkies who lived in a glassy-eyed world. The selkies, led by a hierocracy, practiced ancestor-worship and held liberty as a core value of their culture. Despite being insectivorous, they had a thriving capitalist economy based on gathering resources from the nurturing nature around them during the Bronze Age. However, their society was not without conflict. They had gone to war with neighboring societies before, but always managed to resolve conflicts diplomatically due to their prudent nature. The selkies adorned themselves with embroidered clothing and their architecture was dominated by domes. Their logographic language was a symbol of their advanced technology. The phoenix was a revered symbol in their culture, representing the cycle of life and death. Despite the potential for greed, they had constitutional laws in place to ensure the common good of their society.
