In the wetlands of the spotted kelpies, a mobocracy ruled the land. The community was carnivorous and heavily relied on the industrial technology they had developed during the Golden Age. Their society was inspiring, driven by a culture of honor and a symbiotic relationship with their environment. However, their economy was driven by a plutocracy that left many indifferent to the struggles of the lower classes. The kelpies were confrontational and believed in retributive laws that kept order in their society. Builders were highly regarded, and their architecture featured domes that symbolized their connection to the wetlands. The kelpies communicated through sign language and wore status-oriented fashion that denoted their place in the social hierarchy. Their religion was based on asceticism and centered around the bear, a symbol of strength and resilience. Despite their flaws, the kelpies were an inspiring society that worked together to maintain their way of life.
