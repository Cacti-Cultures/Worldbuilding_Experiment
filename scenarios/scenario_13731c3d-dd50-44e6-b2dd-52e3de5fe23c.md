In the world of the Selkies, a robust society of planktivorous and dominant beings who lived in cave dwellings within the peaks, adventure was the norm. Their language was vowel-heavy, and their fashion was muted, but their respect for each other was unparalleled. They followed the beliefs of paganism and lived a socialist lifestyle, where wealth and resources were shared equally among all. The Selkies were a necrocracy, but they practiced conflict avoidance and followed libertarian laws. However, an uprising was brewing among the Selkies, and discordant voices were growing louder. Some Selkies felt that the wind symbols they used in their culture were not enough to express their dissatisfaction with the current leadership, and they sought to push for change. The geothermal technology used by the farmers was not enough to sustain their society, and the Selkies were beginning to feel the pinch. Despite the looming conflict, the Selkies remained respectful towards each other, and they hoped to find a peaceful solution to their problems.
