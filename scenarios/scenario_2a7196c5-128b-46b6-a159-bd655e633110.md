The Elementals were a society of slithery beings, who lived deep within the rainforest. They were an ethnocracy, with their culture revolving around the belief in a single monotheistic deity. Their economy was based on participatory economics, and they were a carnivorous society. The Elementals were a dominant force in the rainforest, and their architecture reflected this, with their homes built into the mountainsides. They communicated through a pictographic language, and their fashion was layered, with colorful scales and intricate patterns. Despite their communal laws, greed was a negative trait that plagued the Elementals, often leading to combative conflicts over resources. Despite this, they remained confident in their abilities and were known for their skills as gatherers. Justice was an essential part of their culture, and they believed in a fair and equal society. The Elementals were a society steeped in tradition, from their religious beliefs to their symbolic mountain homes. Even during migration events, they remained true to their cultural values and continued to thrive in the rainforest.
