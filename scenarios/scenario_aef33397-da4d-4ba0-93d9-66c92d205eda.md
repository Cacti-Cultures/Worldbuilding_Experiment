In the caverns of the shapeshifters, a heterarchy ruled where warriors were respected, but the society was ultimately patrilineal. The shapeshifters' animistic religion saw nature as indifferent, and the oak was a powerful symbol of balance. The shapeshifters were hospitable, but the recent drought had made them apathetic towards outsiders. Their diet was hematophagous, and they relied on feudalism to sustain their economy. Despite their lack of technology, they harnessed the power of wind to move through the caverns. Their language was rhythmic, and their fashion was ornate. The yurts they built were sturdy and practical. The shapeshifters believed in absolution and the importance of a balanced life. It was said that those who lived in harmony with nature would be granted the gift of shapeshifting.
