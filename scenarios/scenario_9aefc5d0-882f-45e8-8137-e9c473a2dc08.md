In the world of the cyberocracy, the demons were the dominant force, inspiring fear and awe in equal measure. Their society was transparent, with no secrets or hidden agendas, but despite this, they were still considered untrustworthy by many due to their hematophagous diets. The demons were a scholarly culture, with a deep understanding of technology and an industrial architecture that consisted of floating islands in the marshlands. Their language was polysynthetic, with complex grammatical structures that reflected their society's sophistication. The demons were also known for their warrior occupations, as they were constantly engaged in conflicts of absolution with other factions. Despite their fearsome reputation, their religion was iconoclastic, rejecting all symbols and traditions as false idols. The laws of theocratic socialism governed the demons, with a focus on ensuring that all members of their society were provided for equally. Despite their inspiring nature, the demons were still viewed with suspicion by many, as their allegiance to their own kind was always in question. The raven was their symbol, a fitting representation of their mysterious and powerful presence in the world.
