In the highlands of the Vexiarchy, the snouted Yetis lived in yurts embroidered with intricate symbols of ravens, representing their loyalty to their community. Their society was based on the principles of deism, where nature was revered and considered nurturing. Yetis were a tolerant species, but their economy was driven by consumerism, leading them to be selfish at times. Despite this, their laws were theocratic, and they believed in a tonal language that was considered sacred. The Yetis lived in the iron age, and their main occupation was mining. However, their exodus began when they started to clash with other aggressive species over resources. Their diet was hematophagous, which further intensified their conflicts. Nevertheless, the Yetis remained a close-knit community, and their culture of loyalty kept them united.
