In the fae society of Dull, life had always been an anocracy, with power constantly shifting between different factions. Despite this, the community remained vibrant, with colorful festivals and a strong sense of independence. However, the recent drought that plagued the steppes had left the fae feeling unambitious and struggling to survive on their mycophagous diets. The shamanism religion, which had always been a central part of their culture, was now being challenged by the growing trend of consumerism. The renaissance in technology had brought new tools and techniques to the fae artisans, but it had also made their utilitarian lifestyle seem outdated. Conflict was now combative, with groups vying for control over dwindling resources. The only symbol of hope was a passing comet, which the fae saw as a sign of better times to come. They continued to live in their burrow-like architecture, communicating through whistled language and expressing themselves through symbolic fashion. However, the monarchic laws that had once kept their society in order were now being questioned, and the fae were left wondering if they needed a new form of governance to survive.
