In the glowing society of the Satyrs, an ethnocracy ruled by an autocratic system, the warrior occupation persevered through the lethargic tendencies of the coprophagous diet. Their artistic culture was evident in their cave dwellings, draped fashion, and whistled language. The Satyrs' polytheistic religion and wolf symbol influenced their manipulative nature, and their market socialism was powered by wind technology in the canyons. However, the Satyrs faced conflict in their society, which was resolved through compromise during the awakening events. Despite their challenges, the Satyrs persevered as a society, using their unique set of characteristics and laws to thrive in their environment.
