The world had succumbed to a zombie outbreak, with the undead ruling over the few remaining survivors. The society that had formed was agile, with people constantly on the move to avoid the hordes of zombies that roamed the plateau they had found refuge on. However, there was a dictatorship in place, with a pessimistic leader who ruled with an authoritative hand, using coercion to keep the survivors in line.

Despite the bleak situation, the survivors remained tenacious, determined to continue living and fighting against the zombie threat. They had developed a creative culture, with artisans crafting weapons and tools using medieval technology. Insectivorous diets had become the norm, as the survivors had learned that eating insects was a sustainable food source.

Religion had taken a backseat, with most survivors adhering to deism, believing in a higher power but not following any specific doctrine. The economy was informal, with bartering and trade being the norm. The protective nature of the survivors was evident in the way they had constructed their homes, with layered igloos made from willow branches providing much-needed shelter.

Language had become isolating, with different groups of survivors developing their own dialects and slang. Laws were authoritative, with the leader's word being law. Despite the hardships, the survivors had experienced an awakening of sorts, realizing their own strength and resilience in the face of the zombie threat.
