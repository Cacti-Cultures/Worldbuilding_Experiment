In the spiraled society of the pixies, an adventurous spirit was highly valued. Their tellurocracy was run by builders who designed homes in the form of treehouses, utilizing the geography of the grotto they called home. Their religion was based on shamanism, and their culture was centered around creativity. However, their reliance on consumerism and detritivorous diets often led to incompetence and coercion. The cataclysmic winds that sometimes ravaged their community made them rely even more on their utilitarian approach to nature and wind-based technology. Their language was agglutinative and their fashion, futuristic. Despite their communal laws, the dragon symbol was often used to assert dominance.
