In the archipelago of Armored, a gerontocracy of golems rule over the society with their primordial technology, following the principles of deism. The golems' culture values valor and their architecture is dominated by grand castles. However, the society is plagued by famine, leading to a charitable response from some of the community. Despite this, the society is also characterized by ignorance, with many golems failing to understand the needs of their fellow beings. The economy is dominated by a plutocracy and the golems' diet is oophagous. The nature of Armored is symbiotic, where the golems coexist with other creatures on the islands. However, conflicts arise when some golems use intimidation to assert their dominance over others. Occupations such as seers are respected in the society, and the rose is an important symbol. The language is staccato and the fashion is minimalistic. The golems follow theocratic laws, which sometimes exacerbate the social and economic issues that they face.
