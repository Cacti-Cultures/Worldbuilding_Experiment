In a world ruled by the Fae, a society known for their sharp wit and cunning ways, a harmonious existence was maintained with the help of a powerful cyberocracy. However, this utopian society was marred by an unintuitive system of governance, and a culture that heavily favored scholarly pursuits over all else. Despite this, the citizens of this society enjoyed a period of great prosperity, thanks in part to the abundance of resources found in the glaciers that dotted their geography. Religion was divided into dualistic beliefs, with a strong emphasis on the struggle between good and evil. The economy was run on fascist corporatism, with the lower classes forced to resort to scavenging for their diets. Despite their primitive diets, the society was experiencing a renaissance in technology, with new and innovative inventions being created every day. However, the beauty of nature surrounding them also instilled a deep-seated fear in the hearts of many citizens. Conflict was passive, with warrior occupations being reserved for only the bravest and most skilled. The river was a symbol of life and renewal, and the architecture of the society consisted mainly of stilt houses to protect against flooding. The tonal language spoken by the inhabitants was complex and nuanced, and fashion was muted and practical. Laws were autocratic, with the ruling Fae enforcing strict rules and punishments for those who disobeyed them.
