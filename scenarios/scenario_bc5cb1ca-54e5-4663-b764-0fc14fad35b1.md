In the archipelago of scaly beings known as the Phoenixes, a kraterocracy rules with a firm and disciplined hand. Despite their utilitarian approach to nature and scavenger diet, the Phoenixes have a noble society that values the sun as a symbol of hope and renewal. However, their agnosticism and consumerist tendencies have led to a lack of originality in their primordial technology and decorative fashion. The Phoenixes are weavers by occupation, skilled in the art of subterfuge and tonal language, but their migration events have caused conflicts and a need for constitutional laws. In the depths of the ocean, the Phoenixes have built an underwater city, a marvel of architecture that reflects their discipline and pragmatic culture.
