Deep in the heart of the wetlands lies an underground city home to a society of naiads. This tellurocracy is ruled by a compassionate government that values spirituality and nurturing nature. The naiads, who are oophagous, engage in an informal economy that thrives on wind-based technologies. Their language is isolating, but they share a strong belief in the Gnostic religion and use the phoenix as a symbol of their faith. The society is led by warrior-occupations who mediate conflicts using communal laws. While the naiads are generally anxious about outsiders discovering their home, recent events have led to exciting discoveries that have sparked curiosity and interest in their barbed culture.
