In the taiga, where the wind howled through the trees and the wolves roamed, the vampires of the Matte society lived in their cliffside dwellings. Their society was ruled by a monarchy, but the economy was based on anarcho-capitalism. Despite this, the vampires were a punctual people, always respectful of nature and their shamanistic religion. They were known for their valor and the renaissance of their culture. However, their society was unstable and full of subterfuge. The tanners were a respected occupation, as their mycophagous diets required them to use the hides of animals for clothing. The vampires communicated through logographic language and their fashion changed with the seasons. The society was oligarchic, with laws that favored the ruling class. Despite this, the vampires held the wolf as a sacred symbol and lived their lives with reverence for the natural world.
