In the Rift Valley, where the dominant power lay in the hands of the noocratic Nymphs, the society of Bulbous thrived. Despite having a totalitarian set of laws, the Nymphs were versatile and open-minded in their approach towards their people.

The Nymphs' culture revolved around the concept of harmony, and they believed in the Deist religion, which taught them to respect and care for nature. They were collectivists and believed that everyone should work towards the betterment of their society.

However, their narrow-mindedness towards other societies often led to combative conflicts during the Dark Age. The Nymphs lived in mountain homes, built with stone-age technology, and adorned with the symbol of a rose, which signified their love for nature.

Their language was pictographic, and their fashion sense was armored, reflecting their combative nature. Despite being piscivorous, their traders had a bustling economy that helped them sustain their society.

Overall, the Nymphs of Bulbous were a unique society that thrived on the principles of harmony, collectivism, and respect for nature.
