In a faraway land, there existed a society of chubby Garudas living in an ochlocracy, ruled by the strongest and most dominant among them. Despite the unfairness of the system, the Garudas were determined to maintain their loyalty to one another and their respect for nature. However, when a plague swept through their coral reef home, the Garudas were forced to confront their reliance on consumerism and their detritivorous diets. With no advanced technology beyond that of the Stone Age, the Garudas turned to their seers for guidance and spiritualism for comfort. The oak tree became a symbol of hope and the fort architecture was used to quarantine the sick. In this theocratic society, the laws were harmonious and centered around the greater good. But as resources became scarce, coercion began to seep in, causing conflicts and fractures within the society. Still, the Garudas persevered, relying on their armored fashion and their deep sense of loyalty to one another, determined to survive and rebuild in the aftermath of the plague.
