Deep in the heart of the canyons, the ogres lived in oozing caves. The society was a magocracy, where those with the strongest magical abilities were in charge. Despite their combative nature, the ogres were content with their way of life. Their culture was built on honor and respect, and they celebrated a renaissance of art and literature. Their religion was based on gnosticism, where they believed in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Economically, they practiced mercantilism, trading their herbivorous diets for goods and services with neighboring tribes. Their industrial technology was limited, but they were skilled gatherers and used the natural resources around them. Nature was indifferent to their struggles, but the ogres continued to thrive in their environment. Those who chose to quit were seen as weak and dishonorable. Their architecture consisted of cave dwellings, and their language was guttural and difficult for outsiders to understand. Fashion was naturalistic, with fur and leather being the primary materials used for clothing. The ogres lived under an authoritative set of laws, but their society was based on mutual respect and trust. Their symbol was the phoenix, representing their belief in rebirth and renewal.
