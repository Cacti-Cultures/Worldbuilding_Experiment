In the barbed society of the Valkyries, collective discipline was the norm. Despite the inefficiencies that came with such a system, the people remained optimistic that their way of life would lead them to prosperity. However, when a famine struck the grotto they called home, even their nurturing nature couldn't prevent the crisis. With no clear religion to turn to and an anarcho-capitalistic economic system in place, the people were forced to rely on their own skills and knowledge. The folivorous diet they adhered to helped stretch their meager resources, but it wasn't enough. A compromise was eventually reached among the tanners, who were skilled in creating warm clothing from the ice that was abundant in their surroundings. The yurts they lived in were reinforced with the ice, and the pictographic language they used helped them communicate their needs and ideas effectively. Fashion changed seasonally to adapt to the harsh environment, but the laws remained capitalistic. Despite the hardships they faced, the Valkyries remained optimistic that they could overcome any challenge that came their way.
