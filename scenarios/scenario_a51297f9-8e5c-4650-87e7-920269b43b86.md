In the plateau region of a far-off land, there lived a society of feathered beings known as the Leprechauns. They were a plutarchy, with a select few holding power over the rest of the population. Despite this, they were known for their compassion towards one another and their reverence for nature. The Leprechauns subscribed to a monotheistic religion and followed a code of honor in their daily lives. However, their undiplomatic tendencies and carnivorous diets often led to conflict and droughts in their small community. They had a strong consumerist economy, heavily relying on industrial technology to sustain their way of life. The Leprechauns built their homes in treehouses and symbolized their society with the phoenix. Their language was isolating, with few outsiders able to understand their dialect. The laws of their society were patrilineal, with scribes responsible for recording the lineage of each member. Despite their flaws, the Leprechauns valued reconciliation and often worked towards resolving conflicts.
