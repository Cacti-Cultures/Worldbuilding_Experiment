In the badlands of the Fluffy society, the Dryads lived in a crystal palace, built by their ancestors with primordial technology. The Dryads were a noble race, who believed in egalitarianism and respected nature. They followed the practice of hematophagous diets, where they drank the blood of animals with utmost respect towards nature. Their culture valued valor and they had a neutral stance towards religion, practicing agnosticism. The Dryads had a monarchic law system, and their language was guttural, with symbolic fashion that represented their culture. The occupation of a tanner was highly respected in their society, and they used the Phoenix as a symbol of absolution. Recently, a treaty was signed between the Dryads and neighboring societies, which caused unrest among some disloyal Dryads who believed that the treaty would harm their society's capitalist economy. Despite the conflict, the Dryads remained respectful and hoped for a peaceful resolution.
