In the land of the Aos Si, a fiery society ruled by chaocracy, agility was highly valued but inconsistency plagued the people. Justice was a cornerstone of their culture and was celebrated during the awakening, an annual event that marked the start of a new year. The Aos Si inhabited a vast archipelago, and their religion was agnostic. Feudalism was the dominant economic system, and the people were lignivorous, subsisting mainly on plant-based diets. Their technology was primordial, and they lived in harmony with nature, symbolized by the mighty oak. Conflict was often resolved through absolution, and artisans were highly respected members of society. Skyscrapers adorned the cities, and the guttural language spoken by the people was both intriguing and intimidating. Decorative fashion was the norm, and totalitarian laws kept order within the society. Despite their differences, the Aos Si were bound together by their love for their home and their people.
