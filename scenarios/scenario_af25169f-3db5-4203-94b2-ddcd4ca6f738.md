In the bayou, the wights lived in a society that valued physical prowess above all else. They were a meritocracy, and only the strongest and most assertive among them rose to positions of power. However, this often led to a dull and confrontational atmosphere, as those who were not physically gifted were left behind. Despite this, their culture placed a high value on valor and bravery, and they underwent a reformation to try and bring more inclusivity to their society. Their religion was based on dualism, with a belief in both good and evil forces at play in the world. Economically, they were capitalist, with those who were successful in their oophagous diets rising to the top. Technologically, they were in the iron age, with pottery being a common occupation. The oak tree was a symbol of strength and resilience in their culture, and their architecture consisted of burrows dug into the ground. Their language was a click language, and their fashion was primal and simple. Laws were tribal and often enforced through confrontational means. Despite their destructive tendencies, the wights were a proud and resilient people, who valued their physical abilities and were always striving to improve themselves.
