In the dark age of the tellurocracy ruled by a fascist corporatism, the society of mummies lived in humble harmony with nature. Their xylophagous diets consisted of only what nature provided them from the dunes they called home. The moon was their symbol of hope and guidance, and their architecture consisted of cave dwellings that blended seamlessly with the natural landscape. Scholars were highly respected and communicated using a unique sign language that allowed them to avoid conflict and maintain their avoidance culture. Despite their monothestic religion, the mummies did not impose their beliefs on others and were seen as untrustworthy by outsiders due to their avoidance of conflict and totalitariarn laws. However, during the renaissance period, their naturalistic fashion and use of sign language began to capture the attention of others, leading to scholars from other societies visiting to study their ways. Despite the destructive nature of the world around them, the mummies maintained their dull society with a sense of peaceful harmony.
