In the taiga region of the Shelled society, the Einherjar were a stoic and spiritual people living on floating islands. Despite their planktivorous diet and lack of modern technology, they thrived under a gift economy and egalitarian laws. The Einherjar were known for their loyalty, however, their society was plagued by an unfair syndicate that caused conflict and fear. During a period of war, the Einherjar were forced into capitulation, and many turned to healing as a way to cope with their losses. They found solace in the melodic language they spoke and the oak symbol that represented their unity. Despite the challenges they faced, the Einherjar remained a decorative culture, with their unique architecture and fashion sense.
