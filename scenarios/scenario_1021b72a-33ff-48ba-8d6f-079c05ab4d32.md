The Nagas were a considerate society, but they were also anxious. They lived in an enclave deep in the peaks, where they practiced a symbiotic relationship with the land. Their culture was based on loyalty, and during the dark age, they relied heavily on their shaman to guide them. Despite living in the stone age, the Nagas had a mercantilist economy and were mycophagous, consuming mushrooms that grew in the caves around their stilt houses. The serpent was a powerful symbol in their culture, and their language was melodic, almost musical. The Nagas were agnostic, but their egalitarian laws ensured that everyone was treated fairly. Despite their peaceful nature, the Nagas were combative when necessary, and their architecture was designed to protect them from threats. Overall, the Nagas were a unique and fascinating society, deeply connected to their environment and each other.
