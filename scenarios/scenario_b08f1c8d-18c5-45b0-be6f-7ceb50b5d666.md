In the society of Veined, the lignivorous trolls lived in stilt houses scattered across the dunes, utilizing geothermal technology for their daily needs. Despite their cryptocracy, trolls were known for their cooperative nature and utilitarian view of nature. However, the recent invasion by the plutocracy of neighboring kingdoms had caused a conflict of absolution, as the trolls were forced to defend their justice and matrilineal laws against the unintuitive tactics and disregard for nature of the invading forces. The trolls' deism religion and respect for the moon symbol guided them in battle, but they struggled to adapt to the invading army's advanced weaponry. The potters of the troll community worked tirelessly to create defensive structures, but their efforts were not enough. As the trolls fought for their survival and freedom, they faced the challenge of balancing their traditional way of life with the need for innovation and adaptation to the changing world.
