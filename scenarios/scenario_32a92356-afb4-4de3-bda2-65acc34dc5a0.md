In a society of wrinkled Titans, the vibrant energy of the people was overshadowed by the dark presence of the Syndicate, an unobservant group that controlled the economy with anarcho-capitalism. Despite this negative presence, the culture of harmony thrived among the herbivorous diets and geothermal energy that powered the grotto homes. The exodus from the isolated towers led many to become hunters, relying on the destructive nature of the world to provide for them. Though asceticism was a common religious belief, the stars remained a symbol of hope and prosperity. The language spoken was verb-less, relying heavily on body language and tone. Embroidered fashion was a popular trend, showcasing the intricate designs and patterns of the culture. The laws were capitalistic, causing many to struggle under the Syndicate's rule, but the Titans remained resilient in their pursuit of a better future.
