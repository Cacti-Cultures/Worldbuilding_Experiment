In the society of the Tsukumogami, an anocracy prevailed where the ghosts of inanimate objects held power. Despite their dominant nature, the Tsukumogami were gracious and lived in harmony with one another, following the tenants of ancestor-worship as their religion. In this golden age, the economy thrived on a gift economy, and diets were granivorous. The Renaissance brought about technological advancements, and the Tsukumogami architects built their homes into the mountains. Their language was polysynthetic, and they wore beaded clothing as a symbol of their culture. However, laws were strictly theocratic, and any conflicts were met with swift retribution. The Tsukumogami were primarily gatherers, and the sun was a significant symbol in their culture. Despite the hateful tendencies of some Tsukumogami, their society remained in a state of gracious harmony, as their culture emphasized the importance of balance and respect for one another.
