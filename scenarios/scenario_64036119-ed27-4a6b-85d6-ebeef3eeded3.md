In the wetlands of the brawny Valkyries colony, a society grounded in loyalty and market socialism has emerged. While they may be seen as uncreative by outsiders, the Valkyries have found a way to thrive in their symbiotic relationship with the land. Their bronze age technology is used to build functional cave dwellings that blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings. Scholars are highly respected in this society, as they are the ones who bring enlightenment and negotiation to conflicts that arise. The Valkyries are a monotheistic people who follow laws steeped in tribal tradition. Their language is staccato and their fashion is practical, with hematophagous diets necessitating sturdy clothing. Despite their societal differences, the Valkyries have a deep respect for the symbol of ice, seeing it as a reminder of their connection to the land and the importance of balance.
