In the land of Matte, the Norns lived under a disciplined timocracy that valued justice above all else. However, their society was plagued by untrustworthiness, and they often struggled with issues of betrayal and deceit. Despite this, the Norns were a spiritual people, deeply connected to the nurturing glaciers that surrounded their homes. Their economy was based on distributism, and their diets were predominantly hematophagous. Technologically, they were stuck in a medieval era, with blacksmiths being one of the most important occupations in their society. The wind was a powerful symbol for the Norns, and their castles were built to withstand the harsh winds that swept across the glaciers. The Norns spoke a vowel-heavy language and were known for their armored fashion sense. However, their laws were totalitarian, and capitulation was often the only option in conflicts. Despite their flaws, the Norns were a proud people, and their society was deeply rooted in their spiritual beliefs.
