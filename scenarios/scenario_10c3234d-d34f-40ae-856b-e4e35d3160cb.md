In the wetlands of the snouted society, the harpies were known as fierce warriors who protected their territory with arcane technology. Their society was based on distributism, but their autocratic laws made them stingy in sharing their resources with neighboring communities. Despite their reputation for being tough, the harpies were also known for their spontaneous celebrations of pagan rituals during the full moon. Their language was tonal, and their architecture included towering skyscrapers that were both awe-inspiring and intimidating. The harpies' culture valued liberty, but their conflicts often required them to appease their enemies rather than fight them. The harpies were mycophagous, and their diet consisted mainly of fungi. They wore uniforms that displayed their symbols of the moon, and their society was structured as a technocracy where those who held arcane knowledge held the most power. Despite their protective nature, the harpies were feared by neighboring communities who were often invaded by them.
