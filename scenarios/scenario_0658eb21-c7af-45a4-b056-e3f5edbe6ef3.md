In the peaks of the Ethereal world, a colony of honest dwarves lived a peaceful existence. They were known for their artistic culture and their herbivorous diets. However, the dwarves were unenthusiastic about their capitalist economy and the passive conflict that arose from it. They preferred to work as tanners and live in their cliffside dwellings adorned with feathered fashion. The dwarves' language was agglutinative, and their laws were anarchic, allowing them to live freely. But their dominant nature led to an exodus from their homeland due to their iconoclastic beliefs, which sparked a renaissance in their society. As they left their old ways behind, the phoenix became a symbol of their rebirth, and they embraced a new era of creativity and innovation.
