In the land of the Striped Society, the Homunculi lived in a Hermitage deep within the Coral Reefs. They were a resourceful people, adept at surviving off their oophagous diet and thriving in their Bronze Age technology. However, their unstable nature often led to conflict within their Artistic culture, resulting in the Exodus of many from their community. 

The Homunculi practiced Shamanism and often turned to their shamans for mediation during times of conflict. But when their conflicts could not be resolved, they relied on the fascist corporatism of their Monarchic laws to keep order. Despite this, the Homunculi were known for their creativity and innovation, producing beautiful pottery and constructing impressive castles.

Their language, Polysynthetic, was complex and difficult for outsiders to learn, adding to their sense of uniqueness. The storm was a powerful symbol in their culture, representing the destructive forces of nature that they had to contend with living in the Coral Reefs. 

As the Homunculi looked towards the future, their fashion became more futuristic, incorporating new materials and designs. But their past remained an integral part of their identity, and they continued to honor their ancestors through their rituals and traditions.
