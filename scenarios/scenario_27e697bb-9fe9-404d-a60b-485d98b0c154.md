In the grizzled society of the badlands, the kelpies were revered as spiritual symbols of conservation. The oligarchy of blacksmiths and xylophagous dieted citizens relied on the adaptability of the kelpies to survive in the harsh terrain. However, their relationship with the kelpies was not always positive. Hostile invasions from neighboring societies threatened both the kelpies and the people's way of life. Intimidation tactics were used to protect the community, but the kelpies were often caught in the crossfire. Despite all this, the people continued to honor the kelpies, building igloo-like structures as shrines and speaking in a harmonic language during ritualistic ceremonies. The people's laws were capitalistic, and mercantilism drove their economy, yet they still held onto their primordial tech and conservationist nature. The river was a symbol of life and death, as it both sustained the people and brought invasive threats. The kelpies remained a vital part of their culture, and the people strove to find a way to live in harmony with them.
