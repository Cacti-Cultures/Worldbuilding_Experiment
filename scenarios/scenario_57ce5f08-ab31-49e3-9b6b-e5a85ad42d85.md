In the badlands of the Horned society, the Einherjar, a hopeful and spiritually-inclined people, have established a unique form of government - a democratic celestocracy. The Einherjar are known for their protective nature and passive approach to conflict. They have embraced an apatheistic religion and a planktivorous diet. Their language is vowel-heavy and their architecture consists of stilt houses. The Einherjar have a rich tradition of artisanal craftsmanship and their fashion is ritualistic, often incorporating the willow symbol. Their economy is based on capitalism and their technology is arcane. Recently, the Einherjar have undergone a reformation, seeking to revitalize their spirituality and reconnect with their roots. However, their tardiness in implementing these changes has caused some concern among the populace. Despite this, the Einherjar remain a resilient and unique society, committed to their values and determined to thrive in the face of adversity.
