In the highlands of the Horned society, the Phoenixes lived in harmony with the wind and nature. Their culture was based on the principles of liberty and deism, and they practiced a xylophagous diet. The society was structured around a decemvirate, who were authoritative in their laws and rituals. The Phoenixes were known for their sincere and honest approach to life, but there were always those who were insincere and combative. During the migration, the Phoenixes built tall towers as symbols of their culture and language, which was inflected and ritualistic. The potter was a respected occupation, and the Phoenixes used wind technology to power their daily lives. Despite their conflicts, the Phoenixes strived to maintain a harmonious society, and they believed that the sun was a powerful symbol of their beliefs. The Phoenixes embraced syndicalism as their economic system, which allowed them to practice their values of sincerity and liberty.
